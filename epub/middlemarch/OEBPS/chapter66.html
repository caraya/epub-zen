<span class="attribution">— Measure for Measure</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">L</span>ydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his
practice did him in counteracting his personal cares. He had no
longer free energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative
thinking, but by the bedside of patients, the direct external calls
on his judgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to
draw him out of himself. It was not simply that beneficent harness
of routine which enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy
men to live calmly—it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh
application of thought, and on the consideration of another's need
and trial. Many of us looking back through life would say that the
kindest man we have ever known has been a medical man, or perhaps
that surgeon whose fine tact, directed by deeply informed
perception, has come to us in our need with a more sublime
beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some of that
twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his work at the
Hospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to
quiet and sustain him under his anxieties and his sense of mental
degeneracy.</p>
<p>Mr. Farebrother’s suspicion as to the opiate was true, however.
Under the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the
first perception that his marriage, if it were not to be a yoked
loneliness, must be a state of effort to go on loving without too
much care about being loved, he had once or twice tried a dose of
opium. But he had no hereditary constitutional craving after such
transient escapes from the hauntings of misery. He was strong,
could drink a great deal of wine, but did not care about it; and
when the men round him were drinking spirits, he took sugar and
water, having a contemptuous pity even for the earliest stages of
excitement from drink. It was the same with gambling. He had looked
on at a great deal of gambling in Paris, watching it as if it had
been a disease. He was no more tempted by such winning than he was
by drink. He had said to himself that the only winning he cared for
must be attained by a conscious process of high, difficult
combination tending towards a beneficent result. The power he
longed for could not be represented by agitated fingers clutching a
heap of coin, or by the half-barbarous, half-idiotic triumph in the
eyes of a man who sweeps within his arms the ventures of twenty
chapfallen companions.</p>
<p>But just as he had tried opium, so his thought now began to turn
upon gambling—not with appetite for its excitement, but with a sort
of wistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which
implied no asking and brought no responsibility. If he had been in
London or Paris at that time, it is probable that such thoughts,
seconded by opportunity, would have taken him into a
gambling-house, no longer to watch the gamblers, but to watch with
them in kindred eagerness. Repugnance would have been surmounted by
the immense need to win, if chance would be kind enough to let him.
An incident which happened not very long after that airy notion of
getting aid from his uncle had been excluded, was a strong sign of
the effect that might have followed any extant opportunity of
gambling.</p>
<p>The billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of
a certain set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge,
were regarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy
had made part of his memorable debt, having lost money in betting,
and been obliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally
known in Middlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in
this way; and the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place
of dissipation naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation
to go there. Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of
freemasonry, wished that there were something a little more
tremendous to keep to themselves concerning it; but they were not a
closed community, and many decent seniors as well as juniors
occasionally turned into the billiard-room to see what was going
on. Lydgate, who had the muscular aptitude for billiards, and was
fond of the game, had once or twice in the early days after his
arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the cue at the Green
Dragon; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game, and no
inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he had
occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had
engaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse, for
which Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by
this reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he cared
now for every small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of
his tradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he was passing,
would save time.</p>
<p>Mr. Bambridge was not yet come, bat would be sure to arrive
by-and-by, said his friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing
a game for the sake of passing the time. That evening he had the
peculiar light in the eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been
once noticed in him by Mr. Farebrother. The exceptional fact of his
presence was much noticed in the room, where there was a good deal
of Middlemarch company; and several lookers-on, as well as some of
the players, were betting with animation. Lydgate was playing well,
and felt confident; the bets were dropping round him, and with a
swift glancing thought of the probable gain which might double the
sum he was saving from his horse, he began to bet on his own play,
and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come in, but Lydgate did
not notice him. He was not only excited with his play, but visions
were gleaming on him of going the next day to Brassing, where there
was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and where, by one
powerful snatch at the devil’s bait, he might carry it off without
the hook, and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings.</p>
<p>He was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of them
was a young Hawley, just come from his law studies in town, and the
other was Fred Vincy, who had spent several evenings of late at
this old haunt of his. Young Hawley, an accomplished
billiard-player, brought a cool fresh hand to the cue. But Fred
Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and astonished to see him
betting with an excited air, stood aside, and kept out of the
circle round the table.</p>
<p>Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late.
He had been working heartily for six months at all outdoor
occupations under Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had
nearly mastered the defects of his handwriting, this practice
being, perhaps, a little the less severe that it was often carried
on in the evening at Mr. Garth’s under the eyes of Mary. But the
last fortnight Mary had been staying at Lowick Parsonage with the
ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s residence in Middlemarch,
where he was carrying out some parochial plans; and Fred, not
seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned into the Green
Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the old flavor
of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general, considered
from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He had not
been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own to
ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in
his gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was
a little too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in
the traces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman. “I
will tell you what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work to
learn surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write
sermons,” he had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went
through for her sake; “and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were
nothing to me. They had sport, and never learned to write a
bookkeeping hand.” And now, Mary being out of the way for a little
while, Fred, like any other strong dog who cannot slip his collar,
had pulled up the staple of his chain and made a small escape, not
of course meaning to go fast or far. There could be no reason why
he should not play at billiards, but he was determined not to bet.
As to money just now, Fred had in his mind the heroic project of
saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr. Garth offered him,
and returning it, which he could easily do by giving up all futile
money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of clothes, and no
expense in his board. In that way he could, in one year, go a good
way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had deprived
Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more than
she did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this
evening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the
billiard-room, Fred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the
ten pounds which he meant to reserve for himself from his
half-year’s salary (having before him the pleasure of carrying
thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely to be come home again)—he
had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund from which he might risk
something, if there were a chance of a good bet. Why? Well, when
sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he catch a few? He
would never go far along that road again; but a man likes to assure
himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could do in the way
of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from making
himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost
looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it
is not because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal
reasons, which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing
the tingling returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood:
but there was lurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that
when he began to play he should also begin to bet—that he should
enjoy some punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for
feeling “rather seedy” in the morning. It is in such indefinable
movements that action often begins.</p>
<p>But the last thing likely to have entered Fred’s expectation was
that he should see his brother-in-law Lydgate—of whom he had never
quite dropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously
conscious of his superiority—looking excited and betting, just as
he himself might have done. Fred felt a shock greater than he could
quite account for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt,
and that his father had refused to help him; and his own
inclination to enter into the play was suddenly checked. It was a
strange reversal of attitudes: Fred’s blond face and blue eyes,
usually bright and careless, ready to give attention to anything
that held out a promise of amusement, looking involuntarily grave
and almost embarrassed as if by the sight of something unfitting;
while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of self-possessed
strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to lie behind
his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking with
that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal
with fierce eyes and retractile claws.</p>
<p>Lydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds;
but young Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things. He made
first-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s
strokes, the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple
confidence in his own movements to defying another person’s doubt
in them. The defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it
was less sure. He continued to bet on his own play, but began often
to fail. Still he went on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed
into that precipitous crevice of play as if he had been the most
ignorant lounger there. Fred observed that Lydgate was losing fast,
and found himself in the new situation of puzzling his brains to
think of some device by which, without being offensive, he could
withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and perhaps suggest to him a reason
for quitting the room. He saw that others were observing Lydgate’s
strange unlikeness to himself, and it occurred to him that merely
to touch his elbow and call him aside for a moment might rouse him
from his absorption. He could think of nothing cleverer than the
daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see Rosy, and
wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he was going
desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up to
him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and
begged to speak with him.</p>
<p>Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that
he would be down immediately, he went with a new impulse up to
Lydgate, said, “Can I speak to you a moment?” and drew him
aside.</p>
<p>“Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that he wants to
speak to me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was
there, if you had anything to say to him.”</p>
<p>Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because
he could not say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making
everybody stare at you; you had better come away.” But inspiration
could hardly have served him better. Lydgate had not before seen
that Fred was present, and his sudden appearance with an
announcement of Mr. Farebrother had the effect of a sharp
concussion.</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Lydgate; “I have nothing particular to say to
him. But—the game is up—I must be going—I came in just to see
Bambridge.”</p>
<p>“Bambridge is over there, but he is making a row—I don’t think
he’s ready for business. Come down with me to Farebrother. I expect
he is going to blow me up, and you will shield me,” said Fred, with
some adroitness.</p>
<p>Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he felt it,
by refusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he went down. They merely
shook hands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three
had turned into the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say
good-by to Lydgate. His present purpose was clearly to talk with
Fred alone, and he said, kindly, “I disturbed you, young gentleman,
because I have some pressing business with you. Walk with me to St.
Botolph’s, will you?”</p>
<p>It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr.
Farebrother proposed that they should make a circuit to the old
church by the London road. The next thing he said was—</p>
<p>“I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?”</p>
<p>“So did I,” said Fred. “But he said that he went to see
Bambridge.”</p>
<p>“He was not playing, then?”</p>
<p>Fred had not meant to tell this, but he was obliged now to say,
“Yes, he was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have
never seen him there before.”</p>
<p>“You have been going often yourself, then, lately?”</p>
<p>“Oh, about five or six times.”</p>
<p>“I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of
going there?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You know all about it,” said Fred, not liking to be
catechised in this way. “I made a clean breast to you.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter
now. It is understood between us, is it not?—that we are on a
footing of open friendship: I have listened to you, and you will be
willing to listen to me. I may take my turn in talking a little
about myself?”</p>
<p>“I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,”
said Fred, in a state of uncomfortable surmise.</p>
<p>“I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to
me. But I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been
tempted to reverse all that by keeping silence with you just now.
When somebody said to me, ’Young Vincy has taken to being at the
billiard-table every night again—he won’t bear the curb long;’ I
was tempted to do the opposite of what I am doing—to hold my tongue
and wait while you went down the ladder again, betting first and
then—”</p>
<p>“I have not made any bets,” said Fred, hastily.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see
you take the wrong turning, wear out Garth’s patience, and lose the
best opportunity of your life—the opportunity which you made some
rather difficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which
raised that temptation in me—I am sure you know it. I am sure you
know that the satisfaction of your affections stands in the way of
mine.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a
recognition of the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones
of his fine voice gave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could
quell Fred’s alarm.</p>
<p>“I could not be expected to give her up,” he said, after a
moment’s hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of
generosity.</p>
<p>“Clearly not, when her affection met yours. But relations of
this sort, even when they are of long standing, are always liable
to change. I can easily conceive that you might act in a way to
loosen the tie she feels towards you—it must be remembered that she
is only conditionally bound to you—and that in that case, another
man, who may flatter himself that he has a hold on her regard,
might succeed in winning that firm place in her love as well as
respect which you had let slip. I can easily conceive such a
result,” repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically. “There is a
companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage even
over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr.
Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable
tongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. He had a
horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there
was a knowledge of some actual change in Mary’s feeling.</p>
<p>“Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,” he said,
in a troubled voice. “If she is beginning to compare—” He broke
off, not liking to betray all he felt, and then said, by the help
of a little bitterness, “But I thought you were friendly to
me.”</p>
<p>“So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong
disposition to be otherwise. I have said to myself, ’If there is a
likelihood of that youngster doing himself harm, why should you
interfere? Aren’t you worth as much as he is, and don’t your
sixteen years over and above his, in which you have gone rather
hungry, give you more right to satisfaction than he has? If there’s
a chance of his going to the dogs, let him—perhaps you could nohow
hinder it—and do you take the benefit.’”</p>
<p>There was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most
uncomfortable chill. What was coming next? He dreaded to hear that
something had been said to Mary—he felt as if he were listening to
a threat rather than a warning. When the Vicar began again there
was a change in his tone like the encouraging transition to a major
key.</p>
<p>“But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my
old intention. I thought that I could hardly <i>secure myself</i>
in it better, Fred, than by telling you just what had gone on in
me. And now, do you understand me? I want you to make the happiness
of her life and your own, and if there is any chance that a word of
warning from me may turn aside any risk to the contrary—well, I
have uttered it."</p>
<p>There was a drop in the Vicar’s voice when he spoke the last
words He paused—they were standing on a patch of green where the
road diverged towards St. Botolph’s, and he put out his hand, as if
to imply that the conversation was closed. Fred was moved quite
newly. Some one highly susceptible to the contemplation of a fine
act has said, that it produces a sort of regenerating shudder
through the frame, and makes one feel ready to begin a new life. A
good degree of that effect was just then present in Fred Vincy.</p>
<p>“I will try to be worthy,” he said, breaking off before he could
say “of you as well as of her.” And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had
gathered the impulse to say something more.</p>
<p>“You must not imagine that I believe there is at present any
decline in her preference of you, Fred. Set your heart at rest,
that if you keep right, other things will keep right.”</p>
<p>“I shall never forget what you have done,” Fred answered. “I
can’t say anything that seems worth saying—only I will try that
your goodness shall not be thrown away.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Good-by, and God bless you.”</p>
<p>In that way they parted. But both of them walked about a long
while before they went out of the starlight. Much of Fred’s
rumination might be summed up in the words, “It certainly would
have been a fine thing for her to marry Farebrother—but if she
loves me best and I am a good husband?”</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Farebrother’s might be concentrated into a single
shrug and one little speech. “To think of the part one little woman
can play in the life of a man, so that to renounce her may be a
very good imitation of heroism, and to win her may be a
discipline!”</p>
