<blockquote><p>
        Was never true love loved in vain, <br/>
        For truest love is highest gain.<br/>
        No art can make it: it must spring<br/>
        Where elements are fostering.<br/>
            So in heaven's spot and hour<br/>
            Springs the little native flower,<br/>
            Downward root and upward eye,<br/>
            Shapen by the earth and sky.

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">It</span> happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had
that little discussion with Lydgate. Its effect when he went to his
own rooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over
again, under a new irritation, all that he had before thought of
his having settled in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr.
Brooke. Hesitations before he had taken the step had since turned
into susceptibility to every hint that he would have been wiser not
to take it; and hence came his heat towards Lydgate—a heat which
still kept him restless. Was he not making a fool of himself?—and
at a time when he was more than ever conscious of being something
better than a fool? And for what end?</p>
<p>Well, for no definite end. True, he had dreamy visions of
possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and
thoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not
find images rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope
or sting it with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens
to some with a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose
wit “keeps the roadway:” he had his bypaths where there were little
joys of his own choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the
highroad might have thought rather idiotic. The way in which he
made a sort of happiness for himself out of his feeling for
Dorothea was an example of this. It may seem strange, but it is the
fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision of which Mr. Casaubon
suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become a widow, and that
the interest he had established in her mind might turn into
acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting power
over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and
follow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise“ which is
our practical heaven. It was not only that he was unwilling to
entertain thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was
already uneasy in the sense that he had to justify himself from the
charge of ingratitude—the latent consciousness of many other
barriers between himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her
husband, had helped to turn away his imagination from speculating
on what might befall Mr. Casaubon. And there were yet other
reasons. Will, we know, could not bear the thought of any flaw
appearing in his crystal: he was at once exasperated and delighted
by the calm freedom with which Dorothea looked at him and spoke to
him, and there was something so exquisite in thinking of her just
as she was, that he could not long for a change which must somehow
change her. Do we not shun the street version of a fine melody?—or
shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of chiselling or
engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with exultation in
the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is really not
an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day possession?
Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion; and to
Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid
things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have
within him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the
inheritance of a fortune. What others might have called the
futility of his passion, made an additional delight for his
imagination: he was conscious of a generous movement, and of
verifying in his own experience that higher love-poetry which had
charmed his fancy. Dorothea, he said to himself, was forever
enthroned in his soul: no other woman could sit higher than her
footstool; and if he could have written out in immortal syllables
the effect she wrought within him, he might have boasted after the
example of old Drayton, that,—</p>
<p class="poem">“Queens hereafter might be glad to live<br/>
Upon the alms of her superfluous praise."<br/></p>
<p>But this result was questionable. And what else could he do for
Dorothea? What was his devotion worth to her? It was impossible to
tell. He would not go out of her reach. He saw no creature among
her friends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same
simple confidence as to him. She had once said that she would like
him to stay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons
might hiss around her.</p>
<p>This had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations. But
he was not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his
own resolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this
particular night, by some outside demonstration that his public
exertions with Mr. Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he
would like them to be, and this was always associated with the
other ground of irritation—that notwithstanding his sacrifice of
dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could hardly ever see her.
Whereupon, not being able to contradict these unpleasant facts, he
contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I am a fool.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on
Dorothea, he ended, as he had done before, only by getting a
livelier sense of what her presence would be to him; and suddenly
reflecting that the morrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to
Lowick Church and see her. He slept upon that idea, but when he was
dressing in the rational morning light, Objection said—</p>
<p>“That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition
to visit Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!“ argued Inclination, ”it would be too monstrous for
him to hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a
spring morning. And Dorothea will be glad.“</p>
<p>“It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to
annoy him or to see Dorothea.”</p>
<p>“It is not true that I go to annoy him, and why should I not go
to see Dorothea? Is he to have everything to himself and be always
comfortable? Let him smart a little, as other people are obliged to
do. I have always liked the quaintness of the church and
congregation; besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their
pew.”</p>
<p>Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to
Lowick as if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell
Common and skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under
the budding boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen,
and fresh green growths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to
know that it was Sunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick
Church. Will easily felt happy when nothing crossed his humor, and
by this time the thought of vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather
amusing to him, making his face break into its merry smile,
pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine on the water—though the
occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are apt to settle within
ourselves that the man who blocks our way is odious, and not to
mind causing him a little of the disgust which his personality
excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book under his
arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but chanting a
little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and coming
out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his own,
sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The
words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday
experience:—</p>
<p class="poem">“O me, O me, what frugal cheer<br/>
    My love doth feed upon!<br/>
A touch, a ray, that is not here,<br/>
    A shadow that is gone:<br/></p>
<p class="poem">“A dream of breath that might be near,<br/>
    An inly-echoed tone,<br/>
The thought that one may think me dear,<br/>
    The place where one was known,<br/></p>
<p class="poem">“The tremor of a banished fear,<br/>
     An ill that was not done—<br/>
O me, O me, what frugal cheer<br/>
    My love doth feed upon!"<br/></p>
<p>Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward,
and showing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an
incarnation of the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright
creature, abundant in uncertain promises.</p>
<p>The bells were still ringing when he got to Lowick, and he went
into the curate’s pew before any one else arrived there. But he was
still left alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The
curate’s pew was opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small
chancel, and Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come
while he looked round at the group of rural faces which made the
congregation from year to year within the white-washed walls and
dark old pews, hardly with more change than we see in the boughs of
a tree which breaks here and there with age, but yet has young
shoots. Mr. Rigg’s frog-face was something alien and unaccountable,
but notwithstanding this shock to the order of things, there were
still the Waules and the rural stock of the Powderells in their
pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had the same purple round
as ever, and the three generations of decent cottagers came as of
old with a sense of duty to their betters generally—the smaller
children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the black gown and
mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all betters,
and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at
peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the
Sunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at
church in former days, and no one took much note of him except the
choir, who expected him to make a figure in the singing.</p>
<p>Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking
up the short aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the
same she had worn in the Vatican. Her face being, from her
entrance, towards the chancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon
discerned Will, but there was no outward show of her feeling except
a slight paleness and a grave bow as she passed him. To his own
surprise Will felt suddenly uncomfortable, and dared not look at
her after they had bowed to each other. Two minutes later, when Mr.
Casaubon came out of the vestry, and, entering the pew, seated
himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt his paralysis more complete.
He could look nowhere except at the choir in the little gallery
over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps pained, and he had made
a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to vex Mr. Casaubon,
who had the advantage probably of watching him and seeing that he
dared not turn his head. Why had he not imagined this
beforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that
square pew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently
departed from Lowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the
desk. Still he called himself stupid now for not foreseeing that it
would be impossible for him to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she
might feel his coming an impertinence. There was no delivering
himself from his cage, however; and Will found his places and
looked at his book as if he had been a school-mistress, feeling
that the morning service had never been so immeasurably long
before, that he was utterly ridiculous, out of temper, and
miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight of a
woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not
join in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he might have a
cold.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no
change in Will’s situation until the blessing had been pronounced
and every one rose. It was the fashion at Lowick for “the betters”
to go out first. With a sudden determination to break the spell
that was upon him, Will looked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that
gentleman’s eyes were on the button of the pew-door, which he
opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and following her immediately
without raising his eyelids. Will’s glance had caught Dorothea’s as
she turned out of the pew, and again she bowed, but this time with
a look of agitation, as if she were repressing tears. Will walked
out after them, but they went on towards the little gate leading
out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never looking round.</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to follow them, and he could only walk
back sadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden
hopefully in the morning. The lights were all changed for him both
without and within.</p>
