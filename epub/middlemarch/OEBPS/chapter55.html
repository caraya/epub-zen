<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">If</span> youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense
that our elders are hopeful about us; for no age is so apt as youth
to think its emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their
kind. Each crisis seems final, simply because it is new. We are
told that the oldest inhabitants in Peru do not cease to be
agitated by the earthquakes, but they probably see beyond each
shock, and reflect that there are plenty more to come.</p>
<p>To Dorothea, still in that time of youth when the eyes with
their long full lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled
and unwearied as a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning’s
parting with Will Ladislaw seemed to be the close of their personal
relations. He was going away into the distance of unknown years,
and if ever he came back he would be another man. The actual state
of his mind—his proud resolve to give the lie beforehand to any
suspicion that he would play the needy adventurer seeking a rich
woman—lay quite out of her imagination, and she had interpreted all
his behavior easily enough by her supposition that Mr. Casaubon’s
codicil seemed to him, as it did to her, a gross and cruel
interdict on any active friendship between them. Their young
delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one else
would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of the
past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check.
That unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent
chamber she might vent the passionate grief which she herself
wondered at. For the first time she took down the miniature from
the wall and kept it before her, liking to blend the woman who had
been too hardly judged with the grandson whom her own heart and
judgment defended. Can any one who has rejoiced in woman’s
tenderness think it a reproach to her that she took the little oval
picture in her palm and made a bed for it there, and leaned her
cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the creatures who had
suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then that it was
Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before awaking,
with the hues of morning on his wings—that it was Love to whom she
was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless
rigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something
irrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the
future were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls,
ready to construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves
to the fulfilment of their own visions.</p>
<p>One day that she went to Freshitt to fulfil her promise of
staying all night and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to
dine, the Rector being gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm
evening, and even in the delightful drawing-room, where the fine
old turf sloped from the open window towards a lilied pool and
well-planted mounds, the heat was enough to make Celia in her white
muslin and light curls reflect with pity on what Dodo must feel in
her black dress and close cap. But this was not until some episodes
with baby were over, and had left her mind at leisure. She had
seated herself and taken up a fan for some time before she said, in
her quiet guttural—</p>
<p>“Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must
make you feel ill.”</p>
<p>“I am so used to the cap—it has become a sort of shell,” said
Dorothea, smiling. “I feel rather bare and exposed when it is
off.”</p>
<p>“I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,” said Celia,
throwing down her fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty
picture to see this little lady in white muslin unfastening the
widow’s cap from her more majestic sister, and tossing it on to a
chair. Just as the coils and braids of dark-brown hair had been set
free, Sir James entered the room. He looked at the released head,
and said, “Ah!“ in a tone of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“It was I who did it, James,” said Celia. “Dodo need not make
such a slavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more
among her friends.”</p>
<p>“My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her
mourning at least a year.”</p>
<p>“Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs.
Cadwallader, who had some pleasure in startling her good friend the
Dowager. Sir James was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with
Celia’s Maltese dog.</p>
<p>“That is very rare, I hope,” said Lady Chettam, in a tone
intended to guard against such events. “No friend of ours ever
committed herself in that way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very
painful to Lord Grinsell when she did so. Her first husband was
objectionable, which made it the greater wonder. And severely she
was punished for it. They said Captain Beevor dragged her about by
the hair, and held up loaded pistols at her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, if she took the wrong man!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was
in a decidedly wicked mood. “Marriage is always bad then, first or
second. Priority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has
got no other. I would rather have a good second husband than an
indifferent first.”</p>
<p>“My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,” said Lady
Chettam. “I am sure you would be the last woman to marry again
prematurely, if our dear Rector were taken away.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is
lawful to marry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos
instead of Christians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man,
she must take the consequences, and one who does it twice over
deserves her fate. But if she can marry blood, beauty, and
bravery—the sooner the better.”</p>
<p>“I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,”
said Sir James, with a look of disgust. “Suppose we change it.”</p>
<p>“Not on my account, Sir James,” said Dorothea, determined not to
lose the opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique
references to excellent matches. “If you are speaking on my behalf,
I can assure you that no question can be more indifferent and
impersonal to me than second marriage. It is no more to me than if
you talked of women going fox-hunting: whether it is admirable in
them or not, I shall not follow them. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader
amuse herself on that subject as much as on any other.”</p>
<p>“My dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Lady Chettam, in her stateliest
way, “you do not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my
mentioning Mrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to
me. She was step-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy
for his second wife. There could be no possible allusion to
you.”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” said Celia. “Nobody chose the subject; it all came out
of Dodo’s cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A
woman could not be married in a widow’s cap, James.”</p>
<p>“Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “I will not offend
again. I will not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we
to talk about? I, for my part, object to the discussion of Human
Nature, because that is the nature of rectors’ wives.”</p>
<p>Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia
said privately to Dorothea, “Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made
you like yourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as
you used to do, when anything was said to displease you. But I
could hardly make out whether it was James that you thought wrong,
or Mrs. Cadwallader.”</p>
<p>“Neither,“ said Dorothea. ”James spoke out of delicacy to me,
but he was mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs.
Cadwallader said. I should only mind if there were a law obliging
me to take any piece of blood and beauty that she or anybody else
recommended.“</p>
<p>“But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the
better to have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr.
Casaubon had not been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it
would be well to caution Dorothea in time.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my
life. I shall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her
sister’s chin, and looking at her with indulgent affection. Celia
was nursing her baby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to
her.</p>
<p>“Really—quite?“ said Celia. ”Not anybody at all—if he were very
wonderful indeed?“</p>
<p>Dorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have
delightful plans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and
drain it, and make a little colony, where everybody should work,
and all the work should be done well. I should know every one of
the people and be their friend. I am going to have great
consultations with Mr. Garth: he can tell me almost everything I
want to know.”</p>
<p>“Then you <i>will</i> be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?" said
Celia. "Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and
then he can help you."</p>
<p>Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really
quite set against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to
“all sorts of plans,” just like what she used to have. Sir James
made no remark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive
in a woman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from
feeling it a sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware that
the world would regard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially
in relation to a woman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the
world“ being to treat of a young widow’s second marriage as certain
and probably near, and to smile with meaning if the widow acts
accordingly. But if Dorothea did choose to espouse her solitude, he
felt that the resolution would well become her.</p>
