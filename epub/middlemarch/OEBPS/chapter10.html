<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">Y</span>oung Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had
invited him, and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned
that his young relative had started for the Continent, seeming by
this cold vagueness to waive inquiry. Indeed, Will had declined to
fix on any more precise destination than the entire area of Europe.
Genius, he held, is necessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one
hand it must have the utmost play for its spontaneity; on the
other, it may confidently await those messages from the universe
which summon it to its peculiar work, only placing itself in an
attitude of receptivity towards all sublime chances. The attitudes
of receptivity are various, and Will had sincerely tried many of
them. He was not excessively fond of wine, but he had several times
taken too much, simply as an experiment in that form of ecstasy; he
had fasted till he was faint, and then supped on lobster; he had
made himself ill with doses of opium. Nothing greatly original had
resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium had
convinced him that there was an entire dissimilarity between his
constitution and De Quincey's. The superadded circumstance which
would evolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet
beckoned. Even Caesar's fortune at one time was, but a grand
presentiment. We know what a masquerade all development is, and
what effective shapes may be disguised in helpless embryos.—In
fact, the world is full of hopeful analogies and handsome dubious
eggs called possibilities. Will saw clearly enough the pitiable
instances of long incubation producing no chick, and but for
gratitude would have laughed at Casaubon, whose plodding
application, rows of note-books, and small taper of learned theory
exploring the tossed ruins of the world, seemed to enforce a moral
entirely encouraging to Will's generous reliance on the intentions
of the universe with regard to himself. He held that reliance to be
a mark of genius; and certainly it is no mark to the contrary;
genius consisting neither in self-conceit nor in humility, but in a
power to make or do, not anything in general, but something in
particular. Let him start for the Continent, then, without our
pronouncing on his future. Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is
the most gratuitous.</p>
<p>But at present this caution against a too hasty judgment
interests me more in relation to Mr. Casaubon than to his young
cousin. If to Dorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion
which had set alight the fine inflammable material of her youthful
illusions, does it follow that he was fairly represented in the
minds of those less impassioned personages who have hitherto
delivered their judgments concerning him? I protest against any
absolute conclusion, any prejudice derived from Mrs. Cadwallader’s
contempt for a neighboring clergyman’s alleged greatness of soul,
or Sir James Chettam’s poor opinion of his rival’s legs,—from Mr.
Brooke’s failure to elicit a companion’s ideas, or from Celia’s
criticism of a middle-aged scholar’s personal appearance. I am not
sure that the greatest man of his age, if ever that solitary
superlative existed, could escape these unfavorable reflections of
himself in various small mirrors; and even Milton, looking for his
portrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a
bumpkin. Moreover, if Mr. Casaubon, speaking for himself, has
rather a chilling rhetoric, it is not therefore certain that there
is no good work or fine feeling in him. Did not an immortal
physicist and interpreter of hieroglyphs write detestable verses?
Has the theory of the solar system been advanced by graceful
manners and conversational tact? Suppose we turn from outside
estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener interest, what is the
report of his own consciousness about his doings or capacity: with
what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors; what fading of
hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years are marking
off within him; and with what spirit he wrestles against universal
pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him, and bring his
heart to its final pause. Doubtless his lot is important in his own
eyes; and the chief reason that we think he asks too large a place
in our consideration must be our want of room for him, since we
refer him to the Divine regard with perfect confidence; nay, it is
even held sublime for our neighbor to expect the utmost there,
however little he may have got from us. Mr. Casaubon, too, was the
centre of his own world; if he was liable to think that others were
providentially made for him, and especially to consider them in the
light of their fitness for the author of a “Key to all
Mythologies,” this trait is not quite alien to us, and, like the
other mendicant hopes of mortals, claims some of our pity.</p>
<p>Certainly this affair of his marriage with Miss Brooke touched
him more nearly than it did any one of the persons who have
hitherto shown their disapproval of it, and in the present stage of
things I feel more tenderly towards his experience of success than
towards the disappointment of the amiable Sir James. For in truth,
as the day fixed for his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not
find his spirits rising; nor did the contemplation of that
matrimonial garden scene, where, as all experience showed, the path
was to be bordered with flowers, prove persistently more enchanting
to him than the accustomed vaults where he walked taper in hand. He
did not confess to himself, still less could he have breathed to
another, his surprise that though he had won a lovely and
noble-hearted girl he had not won delight,—which he had also
regarded as an object to be found by search. It is true that he
knew all the classical passages implying the contrary; but knowing
classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion, which explains
why they leave so little extra force for their personal
application.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious
bachelorhood had stored up for him a compound interest of
enjoyment, and that large drafts on his affections would not fail
to be honored; for we all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts
entangled in metaphors, and act fatally on the strength of them.
And now he was in danger of being saddened by the very conviction
that his circumstances were unusually happy: there was nothing
external by which he could account for a certain blankness of
sensibility which came over him just when his expectant gladness
should have been most lively, just when he exchanged the accustomed
dulness of his Lowick library for his visits to the Grange. Here
was a weary experience in which he was as utterly condemned to
loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened him while
toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to the
goal. And his was that worst loneliness which would shrink from
sympathy. He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not
less happy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be;
and in relation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and
veneration, he liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening,
as a means of encouragement to himself: in talking to her he
presented all his performance and intention with the reflected
confidence of the pedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that
chilling ideal audience which crowded his laborious uncreative
hours with the vaporous pressure of Tartarean shades.</p>
<p>For to Dorothea, after that toy-box history of the world adapted
to young ladies which had made the chief part of her education, Mr.
Casaubon’s talk about his great book was full of new vistas; and
this sense of revelation, this surprise of a nearer introduction to
Stoics and Alexandrians, as people who had ideas not totally unlike
her own, kept in abeyance for the time her usual eagerness for a
binding theory which could bring her own life and doctrine into
strict connection with that amazing past, and give the remotest
sources of knowledge some bearing on her actions. That more
complete teaching would come—Mr. Casaubon would tell her all that:
she was looking forward to higher initiation in ideas, as she was
looking forward to marriage, and blending her dim conceptions of
both. It would be a great mistake to suppose that Dorothea would
have cared about any share in Mr. Casaubon’s learning as mere
accomplishment; for though opinion in the neighborhood of Freshitt
and Tipton had pronounced her clever, that epithet would not have
described her to circles in whose more precise vocabulary
cleverness implies mere aptitude for knowing and doing, apart from
character. All her eagerness for acquirement lay within that full
current of sympathetic motive in which her ideas and impulses were
habitually swept along. She did not want to deck herself with
knowledge—to wear it loose from the nerves and blood that fed her
action; and if she had written a book she must have done it as
Saint Theresa did, under the command of an authority that
constrained her conscience. But something she yearned for by which
her life might be filled with action at once rational and ardent;
and since the time was gone by for guiding visions and spiritual
directors, since prayer heightened yearning but not instruction,
what lamp was there but knowledge? Surely learned men kept the only
oil; and who more learned than Mr. Casaubon?</p>
<p>Thus in these brief weeks Dorothea’s joyous grateful expectation
was unbroken, and however her lover might occasionally be conscious
of flatness, he could never refer it to any slackening of her
affectionate interest.</p>
<p>The season was mild enough to encourage the project of extending
the wedding journey as far as Rome, and Mr. Casaubon was anxious
for this because he wished to inspect some manuscripts in the
Vatican.</p>
<p>“I still regret that your sister is not to accompany us,” he
said one morning, some time after it had been ascertained that
Celia objected to go, and that Dorothea did not wish for her
companionship. “You will have many lonely hours, Dorotheas, for I
shall be constrained to make the utmost use of my time during our
stay in Rome, and I should feel more at liberty if you had a
companion.”</p>
<p>The words “I should feel more at liberty” grated on Dorothea.
For the first time in speaking to Mr. Casaubon she colored from
annoyance.</p>
<p>“You must have misunderstood me very much,” she said, “if you
think I should not enter into the value of your time—if you think
that I should not willingly give up whatever interfered with your
using it to the best purpose.”</p>
<p>“That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,” said Mr.
Casaubon, not in the least noticing that she was hurt; “but if you
had a lady as your companion, I could put you both under the care
of a cicerone, and we could thus achieve two purposes in the same
space of time.”</p>
<p>“I beg you will not refer to this again,” said Dorothea, rather
haughtily. But immediately she feared that she was wrong, and
turning towards him she laid her hand on his, adding in a different
tone, “Pray do not be anxious about me. I shall have so much to
think of when I am alone. And Tantripp will be a sufficient
companion, just to take care of me. I could not bear to have Celia:
she would be miserable.”</p>
<p>It was time to dress. There was to be a dinner-party that day,
the last of the parties which were held at the Grange as proper
preliminaries to the wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for
moving away at once on the sound of the bell, as if she needed more
than her usual amount of preparation. She was ashamed of being
irritated from some cause she could not define even to herself; for
though she had no intention to be untruthful, her reply had not
touched the real hurt within her. Mr. Casaubon’s words had been
quite reasonable, yet they had brought a vague instantaneous sense
of aloofness on his part.</p>
<p>“Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,” she
said to herself. “How can I have a husband who is so much above me
without knowing that he needs me less than I need him?”</p>
<p>Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right,
she recovered her equanimity, and was an agreeable image of serene
dignity when she came into the drawing-room in her silver-gray
dress—the simple lines of her dark-brown hair parted over her brow
and coiled massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence
from her manner and expression of all search after mere effect.
Sometimes when Dorothea was in company, there seemed to be as
complete an air of repose about her as if she had been a picture of
Santa Barbara looking out from her tower into the clear air; but
these intervals of quietude made the energy of her speech and
emotion the more remarked when some outward appeal had touched
her.</p>
<p>She was naturally the subject of many observations this evening,
for the dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to
the male portion than any which had been held at the Grange since
Mr. Brooke’s nieces had resided with him, so that the talking was
done in duos and trios more or less inharmonious. There was the
newly elected mayor of Middlemarch, who happened to be a
manufacturer; the philanthropic banker his brother-in-law, who
predominated so much in the town that some called him a Methodist,
others a hypocrite, according to the resources of their vocabulary;
and there were various professional men. In fact, Mrs. Cadwallader
said that Brooke was beginning to treat the Middlemarchers, and
that she preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner, who drank her
health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their grandfathers’
furniture. For in that part of the country, before reform had done
its notable part in developing the political consciousness, there
was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of
parties; so that Mr. Brooke’s miscellaneous invitations seemed to
belong to that general laxity which came from his inordinate travel
and habit of taking too much in the form of ideas.</p>
<p>Already, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room,
opportunity was found for some interjectional “asides.“</p>
<p>“A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!”
said Mr. Standish, the old lawyer, who had been so long concerned
with the landed gentry that he had become landed himself, and used
that oath in a deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings,
stamping the speech of a man who held a good position.</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that
gentleman disliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed. The
remark was taken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and
coursing celebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter
egg, a few hairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the
consciousness of a distinguished appearance.</p>
<p>“Yes, but not my style of woman: I like a woman who lays herself
out a little more to please us. There should be a little filigree
about a woman—something of the coquette. A man likes a sort of
challenge. The more of a dead set she makes at you the better.”</p>
<p>“There’s some truth in that,” said Mr. Standish, disposed to be
genial. “And, by God, it’s usually the way with them. I suppose it
answers some wise ends: Providence made them so, eh,
Bulstrode?”</p>
<p>“I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,” said
Mr. Bulstrode. “I should rather refer it to the devil.”</p>
<p>“Ay, to be sure, there should be a little devil in a woman,”
said Mr. Chichely, whose study of the fair sex seemed to have been
detrimental to his theology. “And I like them blond, with a certain
gait, and a swan neck. Between ourselves, the mayor’s daughter is
more to my taste than Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either. If I were a
marrying man I should choose Miss Vincy before either of them.”</p>
<p>“Well, make up, make up,” said Mr. Standish, jocosely; “you see
the middle-aged fellows early the day.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going
to incur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would
choose.</p>
<p>The Miss Vincy who had the honor of being Mr. Chichely’s ideal
was of course not present; for Mr. Brooke, always objecting to go
too far, would not have chosen that his nieces should meet the
daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer, unless it were on a public
occasion. The feminine part of the company included none whom Lady
Chettam or Mrs. Cadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the
colonel’s widow, was not only unexceptionable in point of breeding,
but also interesting on the ground of her complaint, which puzzled
the doctors, and seemed clearly a case wherein the fulness of
professional knowledge might need the supplement of quackery. Lady
Chettam, who attributed her own remarkable health to home-made
bitters united with constant medical attendance, entered with much
exercise of the imagination into Mrs. Renfrew’s account of
symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her case of all,
strengthening medicines.</p>
<p>“Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?”
said the mild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader
reflectively, when Mrs. Renfrew’s attention was called away.</p>
<p>“It strengthens the disease,” said the Rector’s wife, much too
well-born not to be an amateur in medicine. “Everything depends on
the constitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some
bile—that’s my view of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort
of grist to the mill.”</p>
<p>“Then she ought to take medicines that would reduce—reduce the
disease, you know, if you are right, my dear. And I think what you
say is reasonable.”</p>
<p>“Certainly it is reasonable. You have two sorts of potatoes, fed
on the same soil. One of them grows more and more watery—”</p>
<p>“Ah! like this poor Mrs. Renfrew—that is what I think. Dropsy!
There is no swelling yet—it is inward. I should say she ought to
take drying medicines, shouldn’t you?—or a dry hot-air bath. Many
things might be tried, of a drying nature.”</p>
<p>“Let her try a certain person’s pamphlets,” said Mrs.
Cadwallader in an undertone, seeing the gentlemen enter. “He does
not want drying.”</p>
<p>“Who, my dear?” said Lady Chettam, a charming woman, not so
quick as to nullify the pleasure of explanation.</p>
<p>“The bridegroom—Casaubon. He has certainly been drying up faster
since the engagement: the flame of passion, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“I should think he is far from having a good constitution,” said
Lady Chettam, with a still deeper undertone. “And then his
studies—so very dry, as you say.”</p>
<p>“Really, by the side of Sir James, he looks like a death’s head
skinned over for the occasion. Mark my words: in a year from this
time that girl will hate him. She looks up to him as an oracle now,
and by-and-by she will be at the other extreme. All
flightiness!”</p>
<p>“How very shocking! I fear she is headstrong. But tell me—you
know all about him—is there anything very bad? What is the
truth?”</p>
<p>“The truth? he is as bad as the wrong physic—nasty to take, and
sure to disagree.”</p>
<p>“There could not be anything worse than that,” said Lady
Chettam, with so vivid a conception of the physic that she seemed
to have learned something exact about Mr. Casaubon’s disadvantages.
“However, James will hear nothing against Miss Brooke. He says she
is the mirror of women still.”</p>
<p>“That is a generous make-believe of his. Depend upon it, he
likes little Celia better, and she appreciates him. I hope you like
my little Celia?”</p>
<p>“Certainly; she is fonder of geraniums, and seems more docile,
though not so fine a figure. But we were talking of physic. Tell me
about this new young surgeon, Mr. Lydgate. I am told he is
wonderfully clever: he certainly looks it—a fine brow indeed.”</p>
<p>“He is a gentleman. I heard him talking to Humphrey. He talks
well.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Mr. Brooke says he is one of the Lydgates of
Northumberland, really well connected. One does not expect it in a
practitioner of that kind. For my own part, I like a medical man
more on a footing with the servants; they are often all the
cleverer. I assure you I found poor Hicks’s judgment unfailing; I
never knew him wrong. He was coarse and butcher-like, but he knew
my constitution. It was a loss to me his going off so suddenly.
Dear me, what a very animated conversation Miss Brooke seems to be
having with this Mr. Lydgate!”</p>
<p>“She is talking cottages and hospitals with him,” said Mrs.
Cadwallader, whose ears and power of interpretation were quick. “I
believe he is a sort of philanthropist, so Brooke is sure to take
him up.”</p>
<p>“James,“ said Lady Chettam when her son came near, ”bring Mr.
Lydgate and introduce him to me. I want to test him.“</p>
<p>The affable dowager declared herself delighted with this
opportunity of making Mr. Lydgate’s acquaintance, having heard of
his success in treating fever on a new plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Lydgate had the medical accomplishment of looking perfectly
grave whatever nonsense was talked to him, and his dark steady eyes
gave him impressiveness as a listener. He was as little as possible
like the lamented Hicks, especially in a certain careless
refinement about his toilet and utterance. Yet Lady Chettam
gathered much confidence in him. He confirmed her view of her own
constitution as being peculiar, by admitting that all constitutions
might be called peculiar, and he did not deny that hers might be
more peculiar than others. He did not approve of a too lowering
system, including reckless cupping, nor, on the other hand, of
incessant port wine and bark. He said “I think so” with an air of
so much deference accompanying the insight of agreement, that she
formed the most cordial opinion of his talents.</p>
<p>“I am quite pleased with your protege,” she said to Mr. Brooke
before going away.</p>
<p>“My protege?—dear me!—who is that?” said Mr. Brooke.</p>
<p>“This young Lydgate, the new doctor.-He seems to me to
understand his profession admirably.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Lydgate! he is not my protege, you know; only I knew an
uncle of his who sent me a letter about him. However, I think he is
likely to be first-rate—has studied in Paris, knew Broussais; has
ideas, you know—wants to raise the profession.”</p>
<p>“Lydgate has lots of ideas, quite new, about ventilation and
diet, that sort of thing,” resumed Mr. Brooke, after he had handed
out Lady Chettam, and had returned to be civil to a group of
Middlemarchers.</p>
<p>“Hang it, do you think that is quite sound?—upsetting The old
treatment, which has made Englishmen what they re?” said Mr.
Standish.</p>
<p>“Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us,” said Mr.
Bulstrode, who spoke in a subdued tone, and had rather a sickly
air. “I, for my part, hail the advent of Mr. Lydgate. I hope to
find good reason for confiding the new hospital to his
management.”</p>
<p>“That is all very fine,” replied Mr. Standish, who was not fond
of Mr. Bulstrode; “if you like him to try experiments on your
hospital patients, and kill a few people for charity I have no
objection. But I am not going to hand money out of my purse to have
experiments tried on me. I like treatment that has been tested a
little.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, Standish, every dose you take is an
experiment-an experiment, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding
towards the lawyer.</p>
<p>“Oh, if you talk in that sense!” said Mr. Standish, with as much
disgust at such non-legal quibbling as a man can well betray
towards a valuable client.</p>
<p>“I should be glad of any treatment that would cure me without
reducing me to a skeleton, like poor Grainger,” said Mr. Vincy, the
mayor, a florid man, who would have served for a study of flesh in
striking contrast with the Franciscan tints of Mr. Bulstrode. “It’s
an uncommonly dangerous thing to be left without any padding
against the shafts of disease, as somebody said,—and I think it a
very good expression myself.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lydgate, of course, was out of hearing. He had quitted the
party early, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for
the novelty of certain introductions, especially the introduction
to Miss Brooke, whose youthful bloom, with her approaching marriage
to that faded scholar, and her interest in matters socially useful,
gave her the piquancy of an unusual combination.</p>
<p>“She is a good creature—that fine girl—but a little too
earnest,” he thought. “It is troublesome to talk to such women.
They are always wanting reasons, yet they are too ignorant to
understand the merits of any question, and usually fall hack on
their moral sense to settle things after their own taste.”</p>
<p>Evidently Miss Brooke was not Mr. Lydgate’s style of woman any
more than Mr. Chichely’s. Considered, indeed, in relation to the
latter, whose mied was matured, she was altogether a mistake, and
calculated to shock his trust in final causes, including the
adaptation of fine young women to purplefaced bachelors. But
Lydgate was less ripe, and might possibly have experience before
him which would modify his opinion as to the most excellent things
in woman.</p>
<p>Miss Brooke, however, was not again seen by either of these
gentlemen under her maiden name. Not long after that dinner-party
she had become Mrs. Casaubon, and was on her way to Rome.</p>
