<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, she had
promised to go and dine at the parsonage on her return from
Freshitt. There was a frequent interchange of visits between her
and the Farebrother family, which enabled her to say that she was
not at all lonely at the Manor, and to resist for the present the
severe prescription of a lady companion. When she reached home and
remembered her engagement, she was glad of it; and finding that she
had still an hour before she could dress for dinner, she walked
straight to the schoolhouse and entered into a conversation with
the master and mistress about the new bell, giving eager attention
to their small details and repetitions, and getting up a dramatic
sense that her life was very busy. She paused on her way back to
talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some garden-seeds, and
discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the crops that would
make the most return on a perch of ground, and the result of sixty
years' experience as to soils—namely, that if your soil was pretty
mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make it all
of a mummy, why then—</p>
<p>Finding that the social spirit had beguiled her into being
rather late, she dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage
rather earlier than was necessary. That house was never dull, Mr.
Farebrother, like another White of Selborne, having continually
something new to tell of his inarticulate guests and proteges, whom
he was teaching the boys not to torment; and he had just set up a
pair of beautiful goats to be pets of the village in general, and
to walk at large as sacred animals. The evening went by cheerfully
till after tea, Dorothea talking more than usual and dilating with
Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of creatures that
converse compendiously with their antennae, and for aught we know
may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some inarticulate
little sounds were heard which called everybody’s attention.</p>
<p>“Henrietta Noble,” said Mrs. Farebrother, seeing her small
sister moving about the furniture-legs distressfully, “what is the
matter?”</p>
<p>“I have lost my tortoise-shell lozenge-box. I fear the kitten
has rolled it away,” said the tiny old lady, involuntarily
continuing her beaver-like notes.</p>
<p>“Is it a great treasure, aunt?” said Mr. Farebrother, putting up
his glasses and looking at the carpet.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ladislaw gave it me,” said Miss Noble. “A German box—very
pretty, but if it falls it always spins away as far as it can.”</p>
<p>“Oh, if it is Ladislaw’s present,” said Mr. Farebrother, in a
deep tone of comprehension, getting up and hunting. The box was
found at last under a chiffonier, and Miss Noble grasped it with
delight, saying, “it was under a fender the last time.”</p>
<p>“That is an affair of the heart with my aunt,” said Mr.
Farebrother, smiling at Dorothea, as he reseated himself.</p>
<p>“If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs.
Casaubon,” said his mother, emphatically,—“she is like a dog—she
would take their shoes for a pillow and sleep the better.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ladislaw’s shoes, I would,” said Henrietta Noble.</p>
<p>Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return. She was surprised
and annoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently, and
that it was quite useless to try after a recovery of her former
animation. Alarmed at herself—fearing some further betrayal of a
change so marked in its occasion, she rose and said in a low voice
with undisguised anxiety, “I must go; I have overtired myself.”</p>
<p>Mr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, “It is
true; you must have half-exhausted yourself in talking about
Lydgate. That sort of work tells upon one after the excitement is
over.”</p>
<p>He gave her his arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not
attempt to speak, even when he said good-night.</p>
<p>The limit of resistance was reached, and she had sunk back
helpless within the clutch of inescapable anguish. Dismissing
Tantripp with a few faint words, she locked her door, and turning
away from it towards the vacant room she pressed her hands hard on
the top of her head, and moaned out—</p>
<p>“Oh, I did love him!”</p>
<p>Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too
thoroughly to leave any power of thought. She could only cry in
loud whispers, between her sobs, after her lost belief which she
had planted and kept alive from a very little seed since the days
in Rome—after her lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith
to one who, misprized by others, was worthy in her thought—after
her lost woman’s pride of reigning in his memory—after her sweet
dim perspective of hope, that along some pathway they should meet
with unchanged recognition and take up the backward years as a
yesterday.</p>
<p>In that hour she repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude
have looked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man—she
besought hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her
relief from the mysterious incorporeal might of her anguish: she
lay on the bare floor and let the night grow cold around her; while
her grand woman’s frame was shaken by sobs as if she had been a
despairing child.</p>
<p>There were two images—two living forms that tore her heart in
two, as if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her
child divided by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her
breast while her gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is
carried away by the lying woman that has never known the mother’s
pang.</p>
<p>Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the
vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she
had trusted—who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting
the dim vault where she sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and
now, with a full consciousness which had never awakened before, she
stretched out her arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that
their nearness was a parting vision: she discovered her passion to
herself in the unshrinking utterance of despair.</p>
<p>And there, aloof, yet persistently with her, moving wherever she
moved, was the Will Ladislaw’ who was a changed belief exhausted of
hope, a detected illusion—no, a living man towards whom there could
not yet struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of
scorn and indignation and jealous offended pride. The fire of
Dorothea’s anger was not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful
returns of spurning reproach. Why had he come obtruding his life
into hers, hers that might have been whole enough without him? Why
had he brought his cheap regard and his lip-born words to her who
had nothing paltry to give in exchange? He knew that he was
deluding her—wished, in the very moment of farewell, to make her
believe that he gave her the whole price of her heart, and knew
that he had spent it half before. Why had he not stayed among the
crowd of whom she asked nothing—but only prayed that they might be
less contemptible?</p>
<p>But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries
and moans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor
she sobbed herself to sleep.</p>
<p>In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim
around her, she awoke—not with any amazed wondering where she was
or what had happened, but with the clearest consciousness that she
was looking into the eyes of sorrow. She rose, and wrapped warm
things around her, and seated herself in a great chair where she
had often watched before. She was vigorous enough to have borne
that hard night without feeling ill in body, beyond some aching and
fatigue; but she had waked to a new condition: she felt as if her
soul had been liberated from its terrible conflict; she was no
longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit down with it as a
lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts. For now the
thoughts came thickly. It was not in Dorothea’s nature, for longer
than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the narrow cell of her
calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness that only sees
another’s lot as an accident of its own.</p>
<p>She began now to live through that yesterday morning
deliberately again, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and
its possible meaning. Was she alone in that scene? Was it her event
only? She forced herself to think of it as bound up with another
woman’s life—a woman towards whom she had set out with a longing to
carry some clearness and comfort into her beclouded youth. In her
first outleap of jealous indignation and disgust, when quitting the
hateful room, she had flung away all the mercy with which she had
undertaken that visit. She had enveloped both Will and Rosamond in
her burning scorn, and it seemed to her as if Rosamond were burned
out of her sight forever. But that base prompting which makes a
women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless lover, could have
no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the dominant spirit of
justice within her had once overcome the tumult and had once shown
her the truer measure of things. All the active thought with which
she had before been representing to herself the trials of Lydgate’s
lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own, seemed to
have its hidden as well as evident troubles—all this vivid
sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted
itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see
as we saw in the day of our ignorance. She said to her own
irremediable grief, that it should make her more helpful, instead
of driving her back from effort.</p>
<p>And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose
contact with hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been
suppliants bearing the sacred branch? The objects of her rescue
were not to be sought out by her fancy: they were chosen for her.
She yearned towards the perfect Right, that it might make a throne
within her, and rule her errant will. “What should I do—how should
I act now, this very day, if I could clutch my own pain, and compel
it to silence, and think of those three?”</p>
<p>It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there
was light piercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and
looked out towards the bit of road that lay in view, with fields
beyond outside the entrance-gates. On the road there was a man with
a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her baby; in the field
she could see figures moving—perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far
off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and she felt the
largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labor and
endurance. She was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life,
and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a
mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining.</p>
<p>What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite
clear, but something that she could achieve stirred her as with an
approaching murmur which would soon gather distinctness. She took
off the clothes which seemed to have some of the weariness of a
hard watching in them, and began to make her toilet. Presently she
rang for Tantripp, who came in her dressing-gown.</p>
<p>“Why, madam, you’ve never been in bed this blessed night,” burst
out Tantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea’s face,
which in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a
mater dolorosa. “You’ll kill yourself, you <i>will</i>. Anybody
might think now you had a right to give yourself a little
comfort."</p>
<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Tantripp,” said Dorothea, smiling. “I have
slept; I am not ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as
possible. And I want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely
I shall want my new bonnet to-day.”</p>
<p>“They’ve lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and
most thankful I shall be to see you with a couple o’ pounds’ worth
less of crape,” said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. “There’s
a reason in mourning, as I’ve always said; and three folds at the
bottom of your skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet—and if
ever anybody looked like an angel, it’s you in a net quilling—is
what’s consistent for a second year. At least, that’s <i>my</i>
thinking," ended Tantripp, looking anxiously at the fire; "and if
anybody was to marry me flattering himself I should wear those
hijeous weepers two years for him, he'd be deceived by his own
vanity, that's all."</p>
<p>“The fire will do, my good Tan,” said Dorothea, speaking as she
used to do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice;
“get me the coffee.”</p>
<p>She folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her head
against it in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away
wondering at this strange contrariness in her young mistress—that
just the morning when she had more of a widow’s face than ever, she
should have asked for her lighter mourning which she had waived
before. Tantripp would never have found the clew to this mystery.
Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she had not the less an active
life before her because she had buried a private joy; and the
tradition that fresh garments belonged to all initiation, haunting
her mind, made her grasp after even that slight outward help
towards calm resolve. For the resolve was not easy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless at eleven o’clock she was walking towards
Middlemarch, having made up her mind that she would make as quietly
and unnoticeably as possible her second attempt to see and save
Rosamond.</p>
