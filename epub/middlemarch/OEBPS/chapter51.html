<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">No</span> gossip about Mr. Casaubon's will had yet reached Ladislaw:
the air seemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and
the coming election, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with
the rival clatter of itinerant shows; and more private noises were
taken little notice of. The famous "dry election" was at hand, in
which the depths of public feeling might be measured by the low
flood-mark of drink. Will Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this
time; and though Dorothea's widowhood was continually in his
thought, he was so far from wishing to be spoken to on the subject,
that when Lydgate sought him out to tell him what had passed about
the Lowick living, he answered rather waspishly—</p>
<p>“Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs.
Casaubon, and am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt. I
never go there. It is Tory ground, where I and the ’Pioneer’ are no
more welcome than a poacher and his gun.”</p>
<p>The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by
observing that Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to
come to the Grange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself,
seemed now to contrive that he should go there as little as
possible. This was a shuffling concession of Mr. Brooke’s to Sir
James Chettam’s indignant remonstrance; and Will, awake to the
slightest hint in this direction, concluded that he was to be kept
away from the Grange on Dorothea’s account. Her friends, then,
regarded him with some suspicion? Their fears were quite
superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they imagined that he
would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying to win the
favor of a rich woman.</p>
<p>Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself
and Dorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw
her on the other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to
think of going away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible
for him to show any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting
himself to disagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which
others might try to poison.</p>
<p>“We are forever divided,” said Will. “I might as well be at
Rome; she would be no farther from me.” But what we call our
despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There
were plenty of reasons why he should not go—public reasons why he
should not quit his post at this crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the
lurch when he needed “coaching“ for the election, and when there
was so much canvassing, direct and indirect, to be carried on. Will
could not like to leave his own chessmen in the heat of a game; and
any candidate on the right side, even if his brain and marrow had
been as soft as was consistent with a gentlemanly bearing, might
help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke and keep him steadily
to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote for the actual
Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence and power of
pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr. Farebrother’s
prophecy of a fourth candidate ”in the bag“ had not yet been
fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any
other power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a
worthy nodus for interference while there was a second reforming
candidate like Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own
expense; and the fight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory
member, Bagster the new Whig member returned at the last election,
and Brooke the future independent member, who was to fetter himself
for this occasion only. Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all
their forces to the return of Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success
must depend either on plumpers which would leave Bagster in the
rear, or on the new minting of Tory votes into reforming votes. The
latter means, of course, would be preferable.</p>
<p>This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to
Mr. Brooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured
by wavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick
afresh at opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave
Will Ladislaw much trouble.</p>
<p>“You know there are tactics in these things,” said Mr. Brooke;
“meeting people half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, ’Well now,
there’s something in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this
is a peculiar occasion—the country with a will of its own—political
unions—that sort of thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too
sharp a knife, Ladislaw. These ten-pound householders, now: why
ten? Draw the line somewhere—yes: but why just at ten? That’s a
difficult question, now, if you go into it.”</p>
<p>“Of course it is,” said Will, impatiently. “But if you are to
wait till we get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a
revolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy.
As for trimming, this is not a time for trimming.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still
appeared to him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after
an interval the wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he
was again drawn into using them with much hopefulness. At this
stage of affairs he was in excellent spirits, which even supported
him under large advances of money; for his powers of convincing and
persuading had not yet been, tested by anything more difficult than
a chairman’s speech introducing other orators, or a dialogue with a
Middlemarch voter, from which he came away with a sense that he was
a tactician by nature, and that it was a pity he had not gone
earlier into this kind of thing. He was a little conscious of
defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief representative in
Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail trader, and
naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the borough—willing
for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and sugars to
reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially with
both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of
electing members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there
were no danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand,
there would be the painful necessity at last of disappointing
respectable people whose names were on his books. He was accustomed
to receive large orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there
were many of Pinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great
weight of grocery on their side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr.
Brooke, as not too “clever in his intellects,” was the more likely
to forgive a grocer who gave a hostile vote under pressure, had
become confidential in his back parlor.</p>
<p>“As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,” he said, rattling
the small silver in his pocket, and smiling affably. “Will it
support Mrs. Mawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when
I am no more? I put the question <i>fictiously</i>, knowing what
must be the answer. Very well, sir. I ask you what, as a husband
and a father, I am to do when gentlemen come to me and say, 'Do as
you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote against us, I shall get my
groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor I like to feel that I
am benefiting the country by maintaining tradesmen of the right
color.' Those very words have been spoken to me, sir, in the very
chair where you are now sitting. I don't mean by your honorable
self, Mr. Brooke."</p>
<p>“No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains
to me of your goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly,
“until I hear that you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I
shall never order him to go elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr.
Mawmsey, feeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There
would be some pleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that
honorable manner.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing
to put yourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody
by-and-by—a thoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know,
that must come first before the rest can follow. I quite agree with
you that you’ve got to look at the thing in a family light: but
public spirit, now. We’re all one family, you know—it’s all one
cupboard. Such a thing as a vote, now: why, it may help to make
men’s fortunes at the Cape—there’s no knowing what may be the
effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a sense of being a little
out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable. But Mr. Mawmsey
answered in a tone of decisive check.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a
vote I must know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the
effects on my till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll
admit, are what nobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls
after you’ve bought in currants, which are a goods that will not
keep—I’ve never; myself seen into the ins and outs there; which is
a rebuke to human pride. But as to one family, there’s debtor and
creditor, I hope; they’re not going to reform that away; else I
should vote for things staying as they are. Few men have less need
to cry for change than I have, personally speaking—that is, for
self and family. I am not one of those who have nothing to lose: I
mean as to respectability both in parish and private business, and
noways in respect of your honorable self and custom, which you was
good enough to say you would not withdraw from me, vote or no vote,
while the article sent in was satisfactory.”</p>
<p>After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his
wife that he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and
that he didn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his
tactics to Ladislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade
himself that he had no concern with any canvassing except the
purely argumentative sort, and that he worked no meaner engine than
knowledge. Mr. Brooke, necessarily, had his agents, who understood
the nature of the Middlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his
ignorance on the side of the Bill—which were remarkably similar to
the means of enlisting it on the side against the Bill. Will
stopped his ears. Occasionally Parliament, like the rest of our
lives, even to our eating and apparel, could hardly go on if our
imaginations were too active about processes. There were plenty of
dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty business; and Will
protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr. Brooke through
would be quite innocent.</p>
<p>But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to
the majority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had
written out various speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had
begun to perceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of
remembering any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in
search of it, and not easily come back again. To collect documents
is one mode of serving your country, and to remember the contents
of a document is another. No! the only way in which Mr. Brooke
could be coerced into thinking of the right arguments at the right
time was to be well plied with them till they took up all the room
in his brain. But here there was the difficulty of finding room, so
many things having been taken in beforehand. Mr. Brooke himself
observed that his ideas stood rather in his way when he was
speaking.</p>
<p>However, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the
test, for before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain
himself to the worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of
the White Hart, which looked out advantageously at an angle of the
market-place, commanding a large area in front and two converging
streets. It was a fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful:
there was some prospect of an understanding between Bagster’s
committee and Brooke’s, to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a
Liberal lawyer, and such manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr.
Vincy, gave a solidity which almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and
his associates who sat for Pinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr.
Brooke, conscious of having weakened the blasts of the “Trumpet“
against him, by his reforms as a landlord in the last half year,
and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove into the town,
felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored waistcoat.
But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that all
moments seem comfortably remote until the last.</p>
<p>“This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I
shall have a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind
of public made up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”</p>
<p>The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had
never thought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more
attached to him than if he had been sent in a box from London. But
they listened without much disturbance to the speakers who
introduced the candidate, one of them—a political personage from
Brassing, who came to tell Middlemarch its duty—spoke so fully,
that it was alarming to think what the candidate could find to say
after him. Meanwhile the crowd became denser, and as the political
personage neared the end of his speech, Mr. Brooke felt a
remarkable change in his sensations while he still handled his
eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged remarks
with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was
indifferent.</p>
<p>“I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an
easy air, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed
him the supposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was
an abstemious man, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at
no great interval from the first was a surprise to his system which
tended to scatter his energies instead of collecting them. Pray
pity him: so many English gentlemen make themselves miserable by
speechifying on entirely private grounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished
to serve his country by standing for Parliament—which, indeed, may
also be done on private grounds, but being once undertaken does
absolutely demand some speechifying.</p>
<p>It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was
at all anxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should
have it quite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from
Pope. Embarking would be easy, but the vision of open sea that
might come after was alarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the
demon just waking up in his stomach, “somebody may put questions
about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he continued, aloud, “just hand me
the memorandum of the schedules.”</p>
<p>When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers
were quite loud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans,
brayings, and other expressions of adverse theory, which were so
moderate that Mr. Standish (decidedly an old bird) observed in the
ear next to him, “This looks dangerous, by God! Hawley has got some
deeper plan than this.” Still, the cheers were exhilarating, and no
candidate could look more amiable than Mr. Brooke, with the
memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left hand on the rail of the
balcony, and his right trifling with his eye-glass. The striking
points in his appearance were his buff waistcoat, short-clipped
blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began with some
confidence.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”</p>
<p>This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it
seemed natural.</p>
<p>“I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy
in my life—never so happy, you know.”</p>
<p>This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right
thing; for, unhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even
couplets from Pope may be but “fallings from us, vanishings,” when
fear clutches us, and a glass of sherry is hurrying like smoke
among our ideas. Ladislaw, who stood at the window behind the
speaker, thought, “it’s all up now. The only chance is that, since
the best thing won’t always do, floundering may answer for once.”
Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews, fell back on
himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate graceful
subject for a candidate.</p>
<p>“I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends—you’ve known me
on the bench a good while—I’ve always gone a good deal into public
questions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you’re many of you
concerned with machinery, and I’ve been going into that lately. It
won’t do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,
manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of
thing—since Adam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the
globe:—’Observation with extensive view,’ must look everywhere,
’from China to Peru,’ as somebody says—Johnson, I think, ’The
Rambler,’ you know. That is what I have done up to a certain
point—not as far as Peru; but I’ve not always stayed at home—I saw
it wouldn’t do. I’ve been in the Levant, where some of your
Middlemarch goods go—and then, again, in the Baltic. The Baltic,
now.”</p>
<p>Plying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might
have got along, easily to himself, and would have come back from
the remotest seas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had
been set up by the enemy. At one and the same moment there had
risen above the shoulders of the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke,
and within ten yards of him, the effigy of himself: buff-colored
waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral physiognomy, painted on rag; and
there had arisen, apparently in the air, like the note of the
cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of his words. Everybody
looked up at the open windows in the houses at the opposite angles
of the converging streets; but they were either blank, or filled by
laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish mockery in
it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this echo was
not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision of a
natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By
the time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been
running through the audience became a general shout, and but for
the sobering effects of party and that great public cause which the
entanglement of things had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the
laugh might have caught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked,
reprehensively, what the new police was doing; but a voice could
not well be collared, and an attack on the effigy of the candidate
would have been too equivocal, since Hawley probably meant it to be
pelted.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious
of anything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself:
he had even a little singing in the ears, and he was the only
person who had not yet taken distinct account of the echo or
discerned the image of himself. Few things hold the perceptions
more thoroughly captive than anxiety about what we have got to say.
Mr. Brooke heard the laughter; but he had expected some Tory
efforts at disturbance, and he was at this moment additionally
excited by the tickling, stinging sense that his lost exordium was
coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.</p>
<p>“That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his
side-pocket, with an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you
know—but we never want a precedent for the right thing—but there is
Chatham, now; I can’t say I should have supported Chatham, or Pitt,
the younger Pitt—he was not a man of ideas, and we want ideas, you
know.”</p>
<p>“Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,” said a loud rough voice
from the crowd below.</p>
<p>Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr.
Brooke, repeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh
was louder than ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being
himself silent, heard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to
ridicule his interrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he
replied with amenity—</p>
<p>“There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do
we meet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of
the press, liberty—that kind of thing? The Bill, now—you shall have
the Bill”—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass
and take the paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being
practical and coming to particulars. The invisible Punch
followed:—</p>
<p>“You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering
contest, and a seat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand
pounds, seven shillings, and fourpence.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his
eye-glass fall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of
himself, which had come nearer. The next moment he saw it
dolorously bespattered with eggs. His spirit rose a little, and his
voice too.</p>
<p>“Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth—all that is very
well”—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke’s shoulder, as the
echo said, “All that is very well;” then came a hail of eggs,
chiefly aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original,
as if by chance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the
crowd; whistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater
hubbub because there was shouting and struggling to put them down.
No voice would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and
Mr. Brooke, disagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The
frustration would have been less exasperating if it had been less
gamesome and boyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper
reporter “can aver that it endangered the learned gentleman’s
ribs,” or can respectfully bear witness to “the soles of that
gentleman’s boots having been visible above the railing,” has
perhaps more consolations attached to it.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly
as he could, “This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got
the ear of the people by-and-by—but they didn’t give me time. I
should have gone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,” he added,
glancing at Ladislaw. “However, things will come all right at the
nomination.”</p>
<p>But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come
right; on the contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the
political personage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were
brewing new devices.</p>
<p>“It was Bowyer who did it,” said Mr. Standish, evasively. “I
know it as well as if he had been advertised. He’s uncommonly good
at ventriloquism, and he did it uncommonly well, by God! Hawley has
been having him to dinner lately: there’s a fund of talent in
Bowyer.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I
would have invited him to dine,” said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone
through a great deal of inviting for the good of his country.</p>
<p>“There’s not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,”
said Ladislaw, indignantly, “but it seems as if the paltry fellows
were always to turn the scale.”</p>
<p>Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with
his “principal,“ and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a
half-formed resolve to throw up the ”Pioneer” and Mr. Brooke
together. Why should he stay? If the impassable gulf between
himself and Dorothea were ever to be filled up, it must rather be
by his going away and getting into a thoroughly different position
than by staying here and slipping into deserved contempt as an
understrapper of Brooke’s. Then came the young dream of wonders
that he might do—in five years, for example: political writing,
political speaking, would get a higher value now public life was
going to be wider and more national, and they might give him such
distinction that he would not seem to be asking Dorothea to step
down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that she cared
for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware that
he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering
himself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at
five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of
things, where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is
delightful. He could speak and he could write; he could master any
subject if he chose, and he meant always to take the side of reason
and justice, on which he would carry all his ardor. Why should he
not one day be lifted above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel
that he had won that eminence well? Without doubt he would leave
Middlemarch, go to town, and make himself fit for celebrity by
“eating his dinners.”</p>
<p>But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed
between him and Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew
why, even if he were the man she would choose to marry, he would
not marry her. Hence he must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke
a little longer.</p>
<p>But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had
anticipated him in the wish to break up their connection.
Deputations without and voices within had concurred in inducing
that philanthropist to take a stronger measure than usual for the
good of mankind; namely, to withdraw in favor of another candidate,
to whom he left the advantages of his canvassing machinery. He
himself called this a strong measure, but observed that his health
was less capable of sustaining excitement than he had imagined.</p>
<p>“I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won’t do to carry that
too far,” he said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. “I must
pull up. Poor Casaubon was a warning, you know. I’ve made some
heavy advances, but I’ve dug a channel. It’s rather coarse
work—this electioneering, eh, Ladislaw? dare say you are tired of
it. However, we have dug a channel with the ’Pioneer’—put things in
a track, and so on. A more ordinary man than you might carry it on
now—more ordinary, you know.”</p>
<p>“Do you wish me to give it up?” said Will, the quick color
coming in his face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a
turn of three steps with his hands in his pockets. “I am ready to
do so whenever you wish it.”</p>
<p>“As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of
your powers, you know. But about the ’Pioneer,’ I have been
consulting a little with some of the men on our side, and they are
inclined to take it into their hands—indemnify me to a certain
extent—carry it on, in fact. And under the circumstances, you might
like to give up—might find a better field. These people might not
take that high view of you which I have always taken, as an alter
ego, a right hand—though I always looked forward to your doing
something else. I think of having a run into France. But I’ll write
you any letters, you know—to Althorpe and people of that kind. I’ve
met Althorpe.”</p>
<p>“I am exceedingly obliged to you,” said Ladislaw, proudly.
“Since you are going to part with the ’Pioneer,’ I need not trouble
you about the steps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for
the present.”</p>
<p>After Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, “The rest of
the family have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn’t
care now about my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go
of my own movements and not because they are afraid of me.”</p>
