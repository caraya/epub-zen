<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>hat change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode
stated or betrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been
determined in him by some severe experience which he had gone
through since the epoch of Mr. Larcher's sale, when Raffles had
recognized Will Ladislaw, and when the banker had in vain attempted
an act of restitution which might move Divine Providence to arrest
painful consequences.</p>
<p>His certainty that Raffles, unless he were dead, would return to
Middlemarch before long, had been justified. On Christmas Eve he
had reappeared at The Shrubs. Bulstrode was at home to receive him,
and hinder his communication with the rest of the family, but he
could not altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from
compromising himself and alarming his wife. Raffles proved more
unmanageable than he had shown himself to be in his former
appearances, his chronic state of mental restlessness, the growing
effect of habitual intemperance, quickly shaking off every
impression from what was said to him. He insisted on staying in the
house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of evils, felt that this
was at least not a worse alternative than his going into the town.
He kept him in his own room for the evening and saw him to bed,
Raffles all the while amusing himself with the annoyance he was
causing this decent and highly prosperous fellow-sinner, an
amusement which he facetiously expressed as sympathy with his
friend’s pleasure in entertaining a man who had been serviceable to
him, and who had not had all his earnings. There was a cunning
calculation under this noisy joking—a cool resolve to extract
something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from
this new application of torture. But his cunning had a little
overcast its mark.</p>
<p>Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of
Raffles could enable him to imagine. He had told his wife that he
was simply taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of
vice, who might otherwise injure himself; he implied, without the
direct form of falsehood, that there was a family tie which bound
him to this care, and that there were signs of mental alienation in
Raffles which urged caution. He would himself drive the unfortunate
being away the next morning. In these hints he felt that he was
supplying Mrs. Bulstrode with precautionary information for his
daughters and servants, and accounting for his allowing no one but
himself to enter the room even with food and drink. But he sat in
an agony of fear lest Raffles should be overheard in his loud and
plain references to past facts—lest Mrs. Bulstrode should be even
tempted to listen at the door. How could he hinder her, how betray
his terror by opening the door to detect her? She was a woman of
honest direct habits, and little likely to take so low a course in
order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was stronger than
the calculation of probabilities.</p>
<p>In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced
an effect which had not been in his plan. By showing himself
hopelessly unmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong
defiance was the only resource left. After taking Raffles to bed
that night the banker ordered his closed carriage to be ready at
half-past seven the next morning. At six o’clock he had already
been long dressed, and had spent some of his wretchedness in
prayer, pleading his motives for averting the worst evil if in
anything he had used falsity and spoken what was not true before
God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an intensity
disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds. But
many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements
which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they
bring about the end that we fix our mind on and desire. And it is
only what we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine
to be seen by Omniscience.</p>
<p>Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was
apparently in a painful dream. He stood silent, hoping that the
presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually
and gently, for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too
sudden awakening. He had watched for a couple of minutes or more
the shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking,
when Raffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared
round him in terror, trembling and gasping. But he made no further
noise, and Bulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his
recovery.</p>
<p>It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold
peremptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, “I
came to call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered
the carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to
conduct you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway
or await a coach.” Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode
anticipated him imperiously with the words, “Be silent, sir, and
hear what I have to say. I shall supply you with money now, and I
will furnish you with a reasonable sum from time to time, on your
application to me by letter; but if you choose to present yourself
here again, if you return to Middlemarch, if you use your tongue in
a manner injurious to me, you will have to live on such fruits as
your malice can bring you, without help from me. Nobody will pay
you well for blasting my name: I know the worst you can do against
me, and I shall brave it if you dare to thrust yourself upon me
again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without noise, or I will
send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and you may carry
your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you shall have no
sixpence from me to pay your expenses there.”</p>
<p>Bulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous
energy: he had been deliberating on this speech and its probable
effects through a large part of the night; and though he did not
trust to its ultimately saving him from any return of Raffles, he
had concluded that it was the best throw he could make. It
succeeded in enforcing submission from the jaded man this morning:
his empoisoned system at this moment quailed before Bulstrode’s
cold, resolute bearing, and he was taken off quietly in the
carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants imagined
him to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man
like their master, who held his head high in the world, should be
ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him. The banker’s
drive of ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning
of the Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had
recovered his spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there
was the good reason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds.
Various motives urged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he did
not himself inquire closely into all of them. As he had stood
watching Raffles in his uneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his
mind that the man had been much shattered since the first gift of
two hundred pounds.</p>
<p>He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his
resolve not to be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate
Raffles with the fact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to
be quite equal to the risks of defying him. But when, freed from
his repulsive presence, Bulstrode returned to his quiet home, he
brought with him no confidence that he had secured more than a
respite. It was as if he had had a loathsome dream, and could not
shake off its images with their hateful kindred of sensations—as if
on all the pleasant surroundings of his life a dangerous reptile
had left his slimy traces.</p>
<p>Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the
thoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric
of opinion is threatened with ruin?</p>
<p>Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit
of uneasy presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully
avoided any allusion to it. He had been used every day to taste the
flavor of supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the
certainty that he was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion
of his having some discreditable secret, made his voice totter when
he was speaking to edification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s
anxious temperament, is often worse than seeing; and his
imagination continually heightened the anguish of an imminent
disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of Raffles did not
keep the man away—and though he prayed for this result he hardly
hoped for it—the disgrace was certain. In vain he said to himself
that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a
chastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning;
and he judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he
should escape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged him to make
preparations for quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be
reported of him, he would then be at a less scorching distance from
the contempt of his old neighbors; and in a new scene, where his
life would not have gathered the same wide sensibility, the
tormentor, if he pursued him, would be less formidable. To leave
the place finally would, he knew, be extremely painful to his wife,
and on other grounds he would have preferred to stay where he had
struck root. Hence he made his preparations at first in a
conditional way, wishing to leave on all sides an opening for his
return after brief absence, if any favorable intervention of
Providence should dissipate his fears. He was preparing to transfer
his management of the Bank, and to give up any active control of
other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground of his
failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of such
work. The measure would cause him some added expense and some
diminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the
general depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a
principal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize.</p>
<p>This was the experience which had determined his conversation
with Lydgate. But at this time his arrangements had most of them
gone no farther than a stage at which he could recall them if they
proved to be unnecessary. He continually deferred the final steps;
in the midst of his fears, like many a man who is in danger of
shipwreck or of being dashed from his carriage by runaway horses,
he had a clinging impression that something would happen to hinder
the worst, and that to spoil his life by a late transplantation
might be over-hasty—especially since it was difficult to account
satisfactorily to his wife for the project of their indefinite
exile from the only place where she would like to live.</p>
<p>Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management
of the farm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as
well as on all other matters connected with any houses and land he
possessed in or about Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth.
Like every one else who had business of that sort, he wanted to get
the agent who was more anxious for his employer’s interests than
his own. With regard to Stone Court, since Bulstrode wished to
retain his hold on the stock, and to have an arrangement by which
he himself could, if he chose, resume his favorite recreation of
superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to trust to a mere
bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements yearly, and
take a proportionate share of the proceeds.</p>
<p>“May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr.
Garth?” said Bulstrode. “And will you mention to me the yearly sum
which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have
discussed together?”</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it,” said Caleb, in his blunt way. “I’ll see
how I can make it out.”</p>
<p>If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy’s future,
Mr. Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his
work, of which his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he
grew older. But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a
very alluring idea occurred to him about this said letting of Stone
Court. What if Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy
there on the understanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be
responsible for the management? It would be an excellent schooling
for Fred; he might make a modest income there, and still have time
left to get knowledge by helping in other business. He mentioned
his notion to Mrs. Garth with such evident delight that she could
not bear to chill his pleasure by expressing her constant fear of
his undertaking too much.</p>
<p>“The lad would be as happy as two,” he said, throwing himself
back in his chair, and looking radiant, “if I could tell him it was
all settled. Think; Susan! His mind had been running on that place
for years before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a
turn of things as could be that he should hold the place in a good
industrious way after all—by his taking to business. For it’s
likely enough Bulstrode might let him go on, and gradually buy the
stock. He hasn’t made up his mind, I can see, whether or not he
shall settle somewhere else as a lasting thing. I never was better
pleased with a notion in my life. And then the children might be
married by-and-by, Susan.”</p>
<p>“You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are
sure that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a
tone of gentle caution. “And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people
need not help to hasten it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside.
“Marriage is a taming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and
bridle. However, I shall say nothing till I know the ground I’m
treading on. I shall speak to Bulstrode again.”</p>
<p>He took his earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had
anything but a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy, but he had a
strong wish to secure Mr. Garth’s services on many scattered points
of business at which he was sure to be a considerable loser, if
they were under less conscientious management. On that ground he
made no objection to Mr. Garth’s proposal; and there was also
another reason why he was not sorry to give a consent which was to
benefit one of the Vincy family. It was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having
heard of Lydgate’s debts, had been anxious to know whether her
husband could not do something for poor Rosamond, and had been much
troubled on learning from him that Lydgate’s affairs were not
easily remediable, and that the wisest plan was to let them “take
their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for the first time, “I
think you are always a little hard towards my family, Nicholas. And
I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my relatives. Too worldly
they may be, but no one ever had to say that they were not
respectable.”</p>
<p>“My dear Harriet,” said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his wife’s
eyes, which were filling with tears, “I have supplied your brother
with a great deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of
his married children.”</p>
<p>That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance
subsided into pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education
she had always foreseen the fruits of.</p>
<p>But remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he
had to talk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting
Middlemarch, he should be glad to tell her that he had made an
arrangement which might be for the good of her nephew Fred. At
present he had merely mentioned to her that he thought of shutting
up The Shrubs for a few months, and taking a house on the Southern
Coast.</p>
<p>Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in
case of Bulstrode’s departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite
time, Fred Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone
Court on the terms proposed.</p>
<p>Caleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being
given to things, that if his self-control had not been braced by a
little affectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed
everything to Mary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However,
he restrained himself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain
visits which he was making to Stone Court, in order to look more
thoroughly into the state of the land and stock, and take a
preliminary estimate. He was certainly more eager in these visits
than the probable speed of events required him to be; but he was
stimulated by a fatherly delight in occupying his mind with this
bit of probable happiness which he held in store like a hidden
birthday gift for Fred and Mary.</p>
<p>“But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in
the air?” said Mrs. Garth.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” replied Caleb; “the castle will tumble about
nobody’s head.”</p>
