<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond
that he should be away until the evening. Of late she had never
gone beyond her own house and garden, except to church, and once to
see her papa, to whom she said, "If Tertius goes away, you will
help us to move, will you not, papa? I suppose we shall have very
little money. I am sure I hope some one will help us." And Mr.
Vincy had said, "Yes, child, I don't mind a hundred or two. I can
see the end of that." With these exceptions she had sat at home in
languid melancholy and suspense, fixing her mind on Will Ladislaw's
coming as the one point of hope and interest, and associating this
with some new urgency on Lydgate to make immediate arrangements for
leaving Middlemarch and going to London, till she felt assured that
the coming would be a potent cause of the going, without at all
seeing how. This way of establishing sequences is too common to be
fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond. And it is
precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock
when it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is
often to see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing
except the desirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect,
rids us of doubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive. That was
the process going on in poor Rosamond, while she arranged all
objects around her with the same nicety as ever, only with more
slowness—or sat down to the piano, meaning to play, and then
desisting, yet lingering on the music stool with her white fingers
suspended on the wooden front, and looking before her in dreamy
ennui. Her melancholy had become so marked that Lydgate felt a
strange timidity before it, as a perpetual silent reproach, and the
strong man, mastered by his keen sensibilities towards this fair
fragile creature whose life he seemed somehow to have bruised,
shrank from her look, and sometimes started at her approach, fear
of her and fear for her rushing in only the more forcibly after it
had been momentarily expelled by exasperation.</p>
<p>But this morning Rosamond descended from her room upstairs—where
she sometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out—equipped for a
walk in the town. She had a letter to post—a letter addressed to
Mr. Ladislaw and written with charming discretion, but intended to
hasten his arrival by a hint of trouble. The servant-maid, their
sole house-servant now, noticed her coming down-stairs in her
walking dress, and thought “there never did anybody look so pretty
in a bonnet poor thing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was filled with her project of going
to Rosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the
probable future, which gathered round the idea of that visit. Until
yesterday when Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble
in his married life, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been
associated for her with that of Will Ladislaw. Even in her most
uneasy moments—even when she had been agitated by Mrs.
Cadwallader’s painfully graphic report of gossip—her effort, nay,
her strongest impulsive prompting, had been towards the vindication
of Will from any sullying surmises; and when, in her meeting with
him afterwards, she had at first interpreted his words as a
probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he was
determined to cut himself off from indulging, she had had a quick,
sad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant
opportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most
likely shared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in
music. But there had followed his parting words—the few passionate
words in which he had implied that she herself was the object of
whom his love held him in dread, that it was his love for her only
which he was resolved not to declare but to carry away into
banishment. From the time of that parting, Dorothea, believing in
Will’s love for her, believing with a proud delight in his delicate
sense of honor and his determination that no one should impeach him
justly, felt her heart quite at rest as to the regard he might have
for Mrs. Lydgate. She was sure that the regard was blameless.</p>
<p>There are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of
having a sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to
rectitude and purity by their pure belief about us; and our sins
become that worst kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible
altar of trust. “If you are not good, none is good”—those little
words may give a terrific meaning to responsibility, may hold a
vitriolic intensity for remorse.</p>
<p>Dorothea’s nature was of that kind: her own passionate faults
lay along the easily counted open channels of her ardent character;
and while she was full of pity for the visible mistakes of others,
she had not yet any material within her experience for subtle
constructions and suspicions of hidden wrong. But that simplicity
of hers, holding up an ideal for others in her believing conception
of them, was one of the great powers of her womanhood. And it had
from the first acted strongly on Will Ladislaw. He felt, when he
parted from her, that the brief words by which he had tried to
convey to her his feeling about herself and the division which her
fortune made between them, would only profit by their brevity when
Dorothea had to interpret them: he felt that in her mind he had
found his highest estimate.</p>
<p>And he was right there. In the months since their parting
Dorothea had felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation
to each other, as one which was inwardly whole and without blemish.
She had an active force of antagonism within her, when the
antagonism turned on the defence either of plans or persons that
she believed in; and the wrongs which she felt that Will had
received from her husband, and the external conditions which to
others were grounds for slighting him, only gave the more tenacity
to her affection and admiring judgment. And now with the
disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact affecting Will’s
social position, which roused afresh Dorothea’s inward resistance
to what was said about him in that part of her world which lay
within park palings.</p>
<p>“Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker” was a
phrase which had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the
Bulstrode business, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a
worse kind of placard on poor Will’s back than the “Italian with
white mice.” Upright Sir James Chettam was convinced that his own
satisfaction was righteous when he thought with some complacency
that here was an added league to that mountainous distance between
Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled him to dismiss any anxiety in
that direction as too absurd. And perhaps there had been some
pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke’s attention to this ugly bit of
Ladislaw’s genealogy, as a fresh candle for him to see his own
folly by. Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will’s part
in the painful story had been recalled more than once; but she had
uttered no word, being checked now, as she had not been formerly in
speaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between
them which must always remain in consecrated secrecy. But her
silence shrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow;
and this misfortune in Will’s lot which, it seemed, others were
wishing to fling at his back as an opprobrium, only gave something
more of enthusiasm to her clinging thought.</p>
<p>She entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer
union, and yet she had taken no posture of renunciation. She had
accepted her whole relation to Will very simply as part of her
marriage sorrows, and would have thought it very sinful in her to
keep up an inward wail because she was not completely happy, being
rather disposed to dwell on the superfluities of her lot. She could
bear that the chief pleasures of her tenderness should lie in
memory, and the idea of marriage came to her solely as a repulsive
proposition from some suitor of whom she at present knew nothing,
but whose merits, as seen by her friends, would be a source of
torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your property for you, my
dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of suitable
characteristics. “I should like to manage it myself, if I knew what
to do with it,” said Dorothea. No—she adhered to her declaration
that she would never be married again, and in the long valley of
her life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would
come as she walked along the road, and saw her fellow-passengers by
the way.</p>
<p>This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been
strong in all her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a
visit to Mrs. Lydgate, making a sort of background against which
she saw Rosamond’s figure presented to her without hindrances to
her interest and compassion. There was evidently some mental
separation, some barrier to complete confidence which had arisen
between this wife and the husband who had yet made her happiness a
law to him. That was a trouble which no third person must directly
touch. But Dorothea thought with deep pity of the loneliness which
must have come upon Rosamond from the suspicions cast on her
husband; and there would surely be help in the manifestation of
respect for Lydgate and sympathy with her.</p>
<p>“I shall talk to her about her husband,” thought Dorothea, as
she was being driven towards the town. The clear spring morning,
the scent of the moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their
creased-up wealth of greenery from out their half-opened sheaths,
seemed part of the cheerfulness she was feeling from a long
conversation with Mr. Farebrother, who had joyfully accepted the
justifying explanation of Lydgate’s conduct. “I shall take Mrs.
Lydgate good news, and perhaps she will like to talk to me and make
a friend of me.”</p>
<p>Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new
fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she had to get out of
her carriage very near to Lydgate’s, she walked thither across the
street, having told the coachman to wait for some packages. The
street door was open, and the servant was taking the opportunity of
looking out at the carriage which was pausing within sight when it
became apparent to her that the lady who “belonged to it” was
coming towards her.</p>
<p>“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, my lady; I’ll see, if you’ll please to walk in,”
said Martha, a little confused on the score of her kitchen apron,
but collected enough to be sure that “mum“ was not the right title
for this queenly young widow with a carriage and pair. ”Will you
please to walk in, and I’ll go and see.“</p>
<p>“Say that I am Mrs. Casaubon,” said Dorothea, as Martha moved
forward intending to show her into the drawing-room and then to go
up-stairs to see if Rosamond had returned from her walk.</p>
<p>They crossed the broader part of the entrance-hall, and turned
up the passage which led to the garden. The drawing-room door was
unlatched, and Martha, pushing it without looking into the room,
waited for Mrs. Casaubon to enter and then turned away, the door
having swung open and swung back again without noise.</p>
<p>Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning,
being filled with images of things as they had been and were going
to be. She found herself on the other side of the door without
seeing anything remarkable, but immediately she heard a voice
speaking in low tones which startled her as with a sense of
dreaming in daylight, and advancing unconsciously a step or two
beyond the projecting slab of a bookcase, she saw, in the terrible
illumination of a certainty which filled up all outlines, something
which made her pause, motionless, without self-possession enough to
speak.</p>
<p>Seated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against
the wall on a line with the door by which she had entered, she saw
Will Ladislaw: close by him and turned towards him with a flushed
tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond,
her bonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her clasped
both her upraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor.</p>
<p>Rosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently
advancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable
instant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself
impeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of
her presence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands
and rose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested. Will
Ladislaw, starting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea’s
eyes with a new lightning in them, seemed changing to marble: But
she immediately turned them away from him to Rosamond and said in a
firm voice—</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were
here. I called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate,
which I wished to put into your own hands.”</p>
<p>She laid down the letter on the small table which had checked
her retreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant
glance and bow, she went quickly out of the room, meeting in the
passage the surprised Martha, who said she was sorry the mistress
was not at home, and then showed the strange lady out with an
inward reflection that grand people were probably more impatient
than others.</p>
<p>Dorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and
was quickly in her carriage again.</p>
<p>“Drive on to Freshitt Hall,” she said to the coachman, and any
one looking at her might have thought that though she was paler
than usual she was never animated by a more self-possessed energy.
And that was really her experience. It was as if she had drunk a
great draught of scorn that stimulated her beyond the
susceptibility to other feelings. She had seen something so far
below her belief, that her emotions rushed back from it and made an
excited throng without an object. She needed something active to
turn her excitement out upon. She felt power to walk and work for a
day, without meat or drink. And she would carry out the purpose
with which she had started in the morning, of going to Freshitt and
Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished them to
know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial now
presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more
ardent in readiness to be his champion. She had never felt anything
like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her
married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing
pang; and she took it as a sign of new strength.</p>
<p>“Dodo, how very bright your eyes are!” said Celia, when Sir
James was gone out of the room. “And you don’t see anything you
look at, Arthur or anything. You are going to do something
uncomfortable, I know. Is it all about Mr. Lydgate, or has
something else happened?” Celia had been used to watch her sister
with expectation.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, a great many things have happened,” said Dodo, in
her full tones.</p>
<p>“I wonder what,” said Celia, folding her arms cozily and leaning
forward upon them.</p>
<p>“Oh, all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth,”
said Dorothea, lifting her arms to the back of her head.</p>
<p>“Dear me, Dodo, are you going to have a scheme for them?” said
Celia, a little uneasy at this Hamlet-like raving.</p>
<p>But Sir James came in again, ready to accompany Dorothea to the
Grange, and she finished her expedition well, not swerving in her
resolution until she descended at her own door.</p>
