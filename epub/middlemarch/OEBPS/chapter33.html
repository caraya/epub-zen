<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>hat night after twelve o'clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in
Mr. Featherstone's room, and sat there alone through the small
hours. She often chose this task, in which she found some pleasure,
notwithstanding the old man's testiness whenever he demanded her
attentions. There were intervals in which she could sit perfectly
still, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light. The red
fire with its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn
existence calmly independent of the petty passions, the imbecile
desires, the straining after worthless uncertainties, which were
daily moving her contempt. Mary was fond of her own thoughts, and
could amuse herself well sitting in twilight with her hands in her
lap; for, having early had strong reason to believe that things
were not likely to be arranged for her peculiar satisfaction, she
wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance at that fact. And she
had already come to take life very much as a comedy in which she
had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act the mean or
treacherous part. Mary might have become cynical if she had not had
parents whom she honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude
within her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to
make no unreasonable claims.</p>
<p>She sat to-night revolving, as she was wont, the scenes of the
day, her lips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which
her fancy added fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with
their illusions, carrying their fool’s caps unawares, thinking
their own lies opaque while everybody else’s were transparent,
making themselves exceptions to everything, as if when all the
world looked yellow under a lamp they alone were rosy. Yet there
were some illusions under Mary’s eyes which were not quite comic to
her. She was secretly convinced, though she had no other grounds
than her close observation of old Featherstone’s nature, that in
spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about him, they were as
likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he kept at a
distance. She had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy’s evident
alarm lest she and Fred should be alone together, but it did not
hinder her from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would
be affected, if it should turn out that his uncle had left him as
poor as ever. She could make a butt of Fred when he was present,
but she did not enjoy his follies when he was absent.</p>
<p>Yet she liked her thoughts: a vigorous young mind not
overbalanced by passion, finds a good in making acquaintance with
life, and watches its own powers with interest. Mary had plenty of
merriment within.</p>
<p>Her thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the
old man on the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to
feel about an aged creature whose life is not visibly anything but
a remnant of vices. She had always seen the most disagreeable side
of Mr. Featherstone: he was not proud of her, and she was only
useful to him. To be anxious about a soul that is always snapping
at you must be left to the saints of the earth; and Mary was not
one of them. She had never returned him a harsh word, and had
waited on him faithfully: that was her utmost. Old Featherstone
himself was not in the least anxious about his soul, and had
declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.</p>
<p>To-night he had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he
lay remarkably still, until at last Mary heard him rattling his
bunch of keys against the tin box which he always kept in the bed
beside him. About three o’clock he said, with remarkable
distinctness, “Missy, come here!”</p>
<p>Mary obeyed, and found that he had already drawn the tin box
from under the clothes, though he usually asked to have this done
for him; and he had selected the key. He now unlocked the box, and,
drawing from it another key, looked straight at her with eyes that
seemed to have recovered all their sharpness and said, “How many of
’em are in the house?”</p>
<p>“You mean of your own relations, sir,” said Mary, well used to
the old man’s way of speech. He nodded slightly and she went
on.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here.”</p>
<p>“Oh ay, they stick, do they? and the rest—they come every day,
I’ll warrant—Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns? They come
peeping, and counting and casting up?”</p>
<p>“Not all of them every day. Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here
every day, and the others come often.”</p>
<p>The old man listened with a grimace while she spoke, and then
said, relaxing his face, “The more fools they. You hearken, missy.
It’s three o’clock in the morning, and I’ve got all my faculties as
well as ever I had in my life. I know all my property, and where
the money’s put out, and everything. And I’ve made everything ready
to change my mind, and do as I like at the last. Do you hear,
missy? I’ve got my faculties.”</p>
<p>“Well, sir?” said Mary, quietly.</p>
<p>He now lowered his tone with an air of deeper cunning. “I’ve
made two wills, and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell
you. This is the key of my iron chest, in the closet there. You
push well at the side of the brass plate at the top, till it goes
like a bolt: then you can put the key in the front lock and turn
it. See and do that; and take out the topmost paper—Last Will and
Testament—big printed.”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” said Mary, in a firm voice, “I cannot do that.”</p>
<p>“Not do it? I tell you, you must,” said the old man, his voice
beginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.</p>
<p>“I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to
do anything that might lay me open to suspicion.”</p>
<p>“I tell you, I’m in my right mind. Shan’t I do as I like at the
last? I made two wills on purpose. Take the key, I say.”</p>
<p>“No, sir, I will not,” said Mary, more resolutely still. Her
repulsion was getting stronger.</p>
<p>“I tell you, there’s no time to lose.”</p>
<p>“I cannot help that, sir. I will not let the close of your life
soil the beginning of mine. I will not touch your iron chest or
your will.” She moved to a little distance from the bedside.</p>
<p>The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while,
holding the one key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk
he began to work with his bony left hand at emptying the tin box
before him.</p>
<p>“Missy,“ he began to say, hurriedly, ”look here! take the
money—the notes and gold—look here—take it—you shall have it all—do
as I tell you.“</p>
<p>He made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as
possible, and Mary again retreated.</p>
<p>“I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don’t ask me
to do it again. If you do, I must go and call your brother.”</p>
<p>He let his hand fall, and for the first time in her life Mary
saw old Peter Featherstone begin to cry childishly. She said, in as
gentle a tone as she could command, “Pray put up your money, sir;”
and then went away to her seat by the fire, hoping this would help
to convince him that it was useless to say more. Presently he
rallied and said eagerly—</p>
<p>“Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”</p>
<p>Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed
through her mind as to what the burning of a second will might
imply. She had to make a difficult decision in a hurry.</p>
<p>“I will call him, if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others
with him.”</p>
<p>“Nobody else, I say. The young chap. I shall do as I like.”</p>
<p>“Wait till broad daylight, sir, when every one is stirring. Or
let me call Simmons now, to go and fetch the lawyer? He can be here
in less than two hours.”</p>
<p>“Lawyer? What do I want with the lawyer? Nobody shall know—I
say, nobody shall know. I shall do as I like.”</p>
<p>“Let me call some one else, sir,” said Mary, persuasively. She
did not like her position—alone with the old man, who seemed to
show a strange flaring of nervous energy which enabled him to speak
again and again without falling into his usual cough; yet she
desired not to push unnecessarily the contradiction which agitated
him. “Let me, pray, call some one else.”</p>
<p>“You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money.
You’ll never have the chance again. It’s pretty nigh two
hundred—there’s more in the box, and nobody knows how much there
was. Take it and do as I tell you.”</p>
<p>Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old
man, propped up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand
holding out the key, and the money lying on the quilt before him.
She never forgot that vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at
the last. But the way in which he had put the offer of the money
urged her to speak with harder resolution than ever.</p>
<p>“It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I
will not touch your money. I will do anything else I can to comfort
you; but I will not touch your keys or your money.”</p>
<p>“Anything else anything else!” said old Featherstone, with
hoarse rage, which, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet
was only just audible. “I want nothing else. You come here—you come
here.”</p>
<p>Mary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. She saw
him dropping his keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he
looked at her like an aged hyena, the muscles of his face getting
distorted with the effort of his hand. She paused at a safe
distance.</p>
<p>“Let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to
compose yourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by
daylight you can do as you like.”</p>
<p>He lifted the stick, in spite of her being beyond his reach, and
threw it with a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell,
slipping over the foot of the bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated
to her chair by the fire. By-and-by she would go to him with the
cordial. Fatigue would make him passive. It was getting towards the
chillest moment of the morning, the fire had got low, and she could
see through the chink between the moreen window-curtains the light
whitened by the blind. Having put some wood on the fire and thrown
a shawl over her, she sat down, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might
now fall asleep. If she went near him the irritation might be kept
up. He had said nothing after throwing the stick, but she had seen
him taking his keys again and laying his right hand on the money.
He did not put it up, however, and she thought that he was dropping
off to sleep.</p>
<p>But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of
what she had gone through, than she had been by the
reality—questioning those acts of hers which had come imperatively
and excluded all question in the critical moment.</p>
<p>Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every
crevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his
head turned a little on one side. She went towards him with
inaudible steps, and thought that his face looked strangely
motionless; but the next moment the movement of the flame
communicating itself to all objects made her uncertain. The violent
beating of her heart rendered her perceptions so doubtful that even
when she touched him and listened for his breathing, she could not
trust her conclusions. She went to the window and gently propped
aside the curtain and blind, so that the still light of the sky
fell on the bed.</p>
<p>The next moment she ran to the bell and rang it energetically.
In a very little while there was no longer any doubt that Peter
Featherstone was dead, with his right hand clasping the keys, and
his left hand lying on the heap of notes and gold.</p>
