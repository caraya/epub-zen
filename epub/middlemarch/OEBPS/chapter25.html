<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">F</span>red Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not
expect him, and when his uncle was not down-stairs in that case she
might be sitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. He left his horse
in the yard to avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and
entered the parlor without other notice than the noise of the
door-handle. Mary was in her usual corner, laughing over Mrs.
Piozzi's recollections of Johnson, and looked up with the fun still
in her face. It gradually faded as she saw Fred approach her
without speaking, and stand before her with his elbow on the
mantel-piece, looking ill. She too was silent, only raising her
eyes to him inquiringly.</p>
<p>“Mary,“ he began, ”I am a good-for-nothing blackguard.“</p>
<p>“I should think one of those epithets would do at a time,” said
Mary, trying to smile, but feeling alarmed.</p>
<p>“I know you will never think well of me any more. You will think
me a liar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn’t
care for you, or your father and mother. You always do make the
worst of me, I know.”</p>
<p>“I cannot deny that I shall think all that of you, Fred, if you
give me good reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have
done. I would rather know the painful truth than imagine it.”</p>
<p>“I owed money—a hundred and sixty pounds. I asked your father to
put his name to a bill. I thought it would not signify to him. I
made sure of paying the money myself, and I have tried as hard as I
could. And now, I have been so unlucky—a horse has turned out
badly—I can only pay fifty pounds. And I can’t ask my father for
the money: he would not give me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a
hundred a little while ago. So what can I do? And now your father
has no ready money to spare, and your mother will have to pay away
her ninety-two pounds that she has saved, and she says your savings
must go too. You see what a—”</p>
<p>“Oh, poor mother, poor father!” said Mary, her eyes filling with
tears, and a little sob rising which she tried to repress. She
looked straight before her and took no notice of Fred, all the
consequences at home becoming present to her. He too remained
silent for some moments, feeling more miserable than ever. “I
wouldn’t have hurt you for the world, Mary,” he said at last. “You
can never forgive me.”</p>
<p>“What does it matter whether I forgive you?” said Mary,
passionately. “Would that make it any better for my mother to lose
the money she has been earning by lessons for four years, that she
might send Alfred to Mr. Hanmer’s? Should you think all that
pleasant enough if I forgave you?”</p>
<p>“Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say anything,” said Mary, more quietly, “and my
anger is of no use.” She dried her eyes, threw aside her book, rose
and fetched her sewing.</p>
<p>Fred followed her with his eyes, hoping that they would meet
hers, and in that way find access for his imploring penitence. But
no! Mary could easily avoid looking upward.</p>
<p>“I do care about your mother’s money going,” he said, when she
was seated again and sewing quickly. “I wanted to ask you,
Mary—don’t you think that Mr. Featherstone—if you were to tell
him—tell him, I mean, about apprenticing Alfred—would advance the
money?”</p>
<p>“My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work
for our money. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately
given you a hundred pounds. He rarely makes presents; he has never
made presents to us. I am sure my father will not ask him for
anything; and even if I chose to beg of him, it would be of no
use.”</p>
<p>“I am so miserable, Mary—if you knew how miserable I am, you
would be sorry for me.”</p>
<p>“There are other things to be more sorry for than that. But
selfish people always think their own discomfort of more importance
than anything else in the world. I see enough of that every
day.”</p>
<p>“It is hardly fair to call me selfish. If you knew what things
other young men do, you would think me a good way off the
worst.”</p>
<p>“I know that people who spend a great deal of money on
themselves without knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish.
They are always thinking of what they can get for themselves, and
not of what other people may lose.”</p>
<p>“Any man may be unfortunate, Mary, and find himself unable to
pay when he meant it. There is not a better man in the world than
your father, and yet he got into trouble.”</p>
<p>“How dare you make any comparison between my father and you,
Fred?” said Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. “He never got into
trouble by thinking of his own idle pleasures, but because he was
always thinking of the work he was doing for other people. And he
has fared hard, and worked hard to make good everybody’s loss.”</p>
<p>“And you think that I shall never try to make good anything,
Mary. It is not generous to believe the worst of a man. When you
have got any power over him, I think you might try and use it to
make him better; but that is what you never do. However, I’m
going,” Fred ended, languidly. “I shall never speak to you about
anything again. I’m very sorry for all the trouble I’ve
caused—that’s all.”</p>
<p>Mary had dropped her work out of her hand and looked up. There
is often something maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary’s hard
experience had wrought her nature to an impressibility very
different from that hard slight thing which we call girlishness. At
Fred’s last words she felt an instantaneous pang, something like
what a mother feels at the imagined sobs or cries of her naughty
truant child, which may lose itself and get harm. And when, looking
up, her eyes met his dull despairing glance, her pity for him
surmounted her anger and all her other anxieties.</p>
<p>“Oh, Fred, how ill you look! Sit down a moment. Don’t go yet.
Let me tell uncle that you are here. He has been wondering that he
has not seen you for a whole week.” Mary spoke hurriedly, saying
the words that came first without knowing very well what they were,
but saying them in a half-soothing half-beseeching tone, and rising
as if to go away to Mr. Featherstone. Of course Fred felt as if the
clouds had parted and a gleam had come: he moved and stood in her
way.</p>
<p>“Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not
think the worst of me—will not give me up altogether.”</p>
<p>“As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you,” said
Mary, in a mournful tone. “As if it were not very painful to me to
see you an idle frivolous creature. How can you bear to be so
contemptible, when others are working and striving, and there are
so many things to be done—how can you bear to be fit for nothing in
the world that is useful? And with so much good in your
disposition, Fred,—you might be worth a great deal.”</p>
<p>“I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that
you love me.”</p>
<p>“I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always
be hanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him.
What will you be when you are forty? Like Mr. Bowyer, I
suppose—just as idle, living in Mrs. Beck’s front parlor—fat and
shabby, hoping somebody will invite you to dinner—spending your
morning in learning a comic song—oh no! learning a tune on the
flute.”</p>
<p>Mary’s lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as she had
asked that question about Fred’s future (young souls are mobile),
and before she ended, her face had its full illumination of fun. To
him it was like the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at
him, and with a passive sort of smile he tried to reach her hand;
but she slipped away quickly towards the door and said, “I shall
tell uncle. You <i>must</i> see him for a moment or two."</p>
<p>Fred secretly felt that his future was guaranteed against the
fulfilment of Mary’s sarcastic prophecies, apart from that
“anything“ which he was ready to do if she would define it He never
dared in Mary’s presence to approach the subject of his
expectations from Mr. Featherstone, and she always ignored them, as
if everything depended on himself. But if ever he actually came
into the property, she must recognize the change in his position.
All this passed through his mind somewhat languidly, before he went
up to see his uncle. He stayed but a little while, excusing himself
on the ground that he had a cold; and Mary did not reappear before
he left the house. But as he rode home, he began to be more
conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy.</p>
<p>When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary
was not surprised, although he seldom had leisure for paying her a
visit, and was not at all fond of having to talk with Mr.
Featherstone. The old man, on the other hand, felt himself ill at
ease with a brother-in-law whom he could not annoy, who did not
mind about being considered poor, had nothing to ask of him, and
understood all kinds of farming and mining business better than he
did. But Mary had felt sure that her parents would want to see her,
and if her father had not come, she would have obtained leave to go
home for an hour or two the next day. After discussing prices
during tea with Mr. Featherstone Caleb rose to bid him good-by, and
said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.”</p>
<p>She took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no
fire, and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table,
turned round to her father, and putting her arms round his neck
kissed him with childish kisses which he delighted in,—the
expression of his large brows softening as the expression of a
great beautiful dog softens when it is caressed. Mary was his
favorite child, and whatever Susan might say, and right as she was
on all other subjects, Caleb thought it natural that Fred or any
one else should think Mary more lovable than other girls.</p>
<p>“I’ve got something to tell you, my dear,” said Caleb in his
hesitating way. “No very good news; but then it might be
worse.”</p>
<p>“About money, father? I think I know what it is.”</p>
<p>“Ay? how can that be? You see, I’ve been a bit of a fool again,
and put my name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your
mother has got to part with her savings, that’s the worst of it,
and even they won’t quite make things even. We wanted a hundred and
ten pounds: your mother has ninety-two, and I have none to spare in
the bank; and she thinks that you have some savings.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes; I have more than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you
would come, father, so I put it in my bag. See! beautiful white
notes and gold.”</p>
<p>Mary took out the folded money from her reticule and put it into
her father’s hand.</p>
<p>“Well, but how—we only want eighteen—here, put the rest back,
child,—but how did you know about it?” said Caleb, who, in his
unconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly
concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary’s
affections.</p>
<p>“Fred told me this morning.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Did he come on purpose?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so. He was a good deal distressed.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,” said the father,
with hesitating tenderness. “He means better than he acts, perhaps.
But I should think it a pity for any body’s happiness to be wrapped
up in him, and so would your mother.”</p>
<p>“And so should I, father,” said Mary, not looking up, but
putting the back of her father’s hand against her cheek.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be
something between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You
see, Mary”—here Caleb’s voice became more tender; he had been
pushing his hat about on the table and looking at it, but finally
he turned his eyes on his daughter—“a woman, let her be as good as
she may, has got to put up with the life her husband makes for her.
Your mother has had to put up with a good deal because of me.”</p>
<p>Mary turned the back of her father’s hand to her lips and smiled
at him.</p>
<p>“Well, well, nobody’s perfect, but”—here Mr. Garth shook his
head to help out the inadequacy of words—“what I am thinking of
is—what it must be for a wife when she’s never sure of her husband,
when he hasn’t got a principle in him to make him more afraid of
doing the wrong thing by others than of getting his own toes
pinched. That’s the long and the short of it, Mary. Young folks may
get fond of each other before they know what life is, and they may
think it all holiday if they can only get together; but it soon
turns into working day, my dear. However, you have more sense than
most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool: there may be no
occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for his
daughter, and you are all by yourself here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her
father’s eyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is
kind-hearted and affectionate, and not false, I think, with all his
self-indulgence. But I will never engage myself to one who has no
manly independence, and who goes on loitering away his time on the
chance that others will provide for him. You and my mother have
taught me too much pride for that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right—that’s right. Then I am easy,” said Mr. Garth,
taking up his hat. “But it’s hard to run away with your earnings,
eh child.”</p>
<p>“Father!“ said Mary, in her deepest tone of remonstrance. ”Take
pocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,“ was her last word
before he closed the outer door on himself.</p>
<p>“I suppose your father wanted your earnings,” said old Mr.
Featherstone, with his usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary
returned to him. “He makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You’re of age
now; you ought to be saving for yourself.”</p>
<p>“I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir,”
said Mary, coldly.</p>
<p>Mr. Featherstone grunted: he could not deny that an ordinary
sort of girl like her might be expected to be useful, so he thought
of another rejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. “If
Fred Vincy comes to-morrow, now, don’t you keep him chattering: let
him come up to me.”</p>
