<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">By</span> that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court
were scenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been
a guest worthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her
abode at Lowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become
rather oppressive: to sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking
rapturously at Celia's baby would not do for many hours in the day,
and to remain in that momentous babe's presence with persistent
disregard was a course that could not have been tolerated in a
childless sister. Dorothea would have been capable of carrying baby
joyfully for a mile if there had been need, and of loving it the
more tenderly for that labor; but to an aunt who does not recognize
her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has nothing to do for him but to
admire, his behavior is apt to appear monotonous, and the interest
of watching him exhaustible. This possibility was quite hidden from
Celia, who felt that Dorothea's childless widowhood fell in quite
prettily with the birth of little Arthur (baby was named after Mr.
Brooke).</p>
<p>“Dodo is just the creature not to mind about having anything of
her own—children or anything!” said Celia to her husband. “And if
she had had a baby, it never could have been such a dear as Arthur.
Could it, James?</p>
<p>“Not if it had been like Casaubon,” said Sir James, conscious of
some indirectness in his answer, and of holding a strictly private
opinion as to the perfections of his first-born.</p>
<p>“No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,” said Celia; “and I
think it is very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She can be just as
fond of our baby as if it were her own, and she can have as many
notions of her own as she likes.”</p>
<p>“It is a pity she was not a queen,” said the devout Sir
James.</p>
<p>“But what should we have been then? We must have been something
else,” said Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of
imagination. “I like her better as she is.”</p>
<p>Hence, when she found that Dorothea was making arrangements for
her final departure to Lowick, Celia raised her eyebrows with
disappointment, and in her quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow
of sarcasm.</p>
<p>“What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is
nothing to be done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it
makes you quite melancholy. And here you have been so happy going
all about Tipton with Mr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now
uncle is abroad, you and Mr. Garth can have it all your own way;
and I am sure James does everything you tell him.”</p>
<p>“I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the
better,” said Dorothea.</p>
<p>“But you will never see him washed,” said Celia; “and that is
quite the best part of the day.” She was almost pouting: it did
seem to her very hard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she
might stay.</p>
<p>“Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,” said
Dorothea; “but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish
to know the Farebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother
about what there is to be done in Middlemarch.”</p>
<p>Dorothea’s native strength of will was no longer all converted
into resolute submission. She had a great yearning to be at Lowick,
and was simply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her
reasons. But every one around her disapproved. Sir James was much
pained, and offered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for
a few months with the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at
that period a man could hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham
were rejected.</p>
<p>The Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her
daughter in town, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be
written to, and invited to accept the office of companion to Mrs.
Casaubon: it was not credible that Dorothea as a young widow would
think of living alone in the house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been
reader and secretary to royal personages, and in point of knowledge
and sentiments even Dorothea could have nothing to object to
her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, “You will certainly go mad in
that house alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to
exert ourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same
names as other people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons
and women who have no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad:
they are taken care of then. But you must not run into that. I dare
say you are a little bored here with our good dowager; but think
what a bore you might become yourself to your fellow-creatures if
you were always playing tragedy queen and taking things sublimely.
Sitting alone in that library at Lowick you may fancy yourself
ruling the weather; you must get a few people round you who
wouldn’t believe you if you told them. That is a good lowering
medicine.”</p>
<p>“I never called everything by the same name that all the people
about me did,” said Dorothea, stoutly.</p>
<p>“But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,” said
Mrs. Cadwallader, “and that is a proof of sanity.”</p>
<p>Dorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her. “No,“
she said, ”I still think that the greater part of the world is
mistaken about many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think
so, since the greater part of the world has often had to come round
from its opinion.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to
her husband she remarked, “It will be well for her to marry again
as soon as it is proper, if one could get her among the right
people. Of course the Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly
a husband is the best thing to keep her in order. If we were not so
poor I would invite Lord Triton. He will be marquis some day, and
there is no denying that she would make a good marchioness: she
looks handsomer than ever in her mourning.”</p>
<p>“My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances
are of no use,” said the easy Rector.</p>
<p>“No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women
together? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and
shut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible
matches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is
precisely the man: full of plans for making the people happy in a
soft-headed sort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.”</p>
<p>“Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.”</p>
<p>“That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if
she has no variety to choose from? A woman’s choice usually means
taking the only man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her
friends don’t exert themselves, there will be a worse business than
the Casaubon business yet.”</p>
<p>“For heaven’s sake don’t touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a
very sore point with Sir James He would be deeply offended if you
entered on it to him unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>“I have never entered on it,” said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her
hands. “Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without
any asking of mine.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand
that the young fellow is going out of the neighborhood.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her husband three
significant nods, with a very sarcastic expression in her dark
eyes.</p>
<p>Dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and
persuasion. So by the end of June the shutters were all opened at
Lowick Manor, and the morning gazed calmly into the library,
shining on the rows of note-books as it shines on the weary waste
planted with huge stones, the mute memorial of a forgotten faith;
and the evening laden with roses entered silently into the
blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose oftenest to sit. At first
she walked into every room, questioning the eighteen months of her
married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if they were a speech
to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in the library and
could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all the
note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in
orderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining
compelling motive in her life with him still clung about his image,
even while she remonstrated with him in indignant thought and told
him that he was unjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be
smiled at as superstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use
of Mrs. Casaubon, she carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within
the envelope, “I could not use it. Do you not see now that I could
not submit my soul to yours, by working hopelessly at what I have
no belief in—Dorothea?” Then she deposited the paper in her own
desk.</p>
<p>That silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because
underneath and through it all there was always the deep longing
which had really determined her to come to Lowick. The longing was
to see Will Ladislaw. She did not know any good that could come of
their meeting: she was helpless; her hands had been tied from
making up to him for any unfairness in his lot. But her soul
thirsted to see him. How could it be otherwise? If a princess in
the days of enchantment had seen a four-footed creature from among
those which live in herds come to her once and again with a human
gaze which rested upon her with choice and beseeching, what would
she think of in her journeying, what would she look for when the
herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which had found her, and
which she would know again. Life would be no better than
candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not
touched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy. It
was true that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and
especially to talk to the new rector, but also true that
remembering what Lydgate had told her about Will Ladislaw and
little Miss Noble, she counted on Will’s coming to Lowick to see
the Farebrother family. The very first Sunday, <i>before</i> she
entered the church, she saw him as she had seen him the last time
she was there, alone in the clergyman's pew; but <i>when</i> she
entered his figure was gone.</p>
<p>In the week-days when she went to see the ladies at the Rectory,
she listened in vain for some word that they might let fall about
Will; but it seemed to her that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every
one else in the neighborhood and out of it.</p>
<p>“Probably some of Mr. Farebrother’s Middlemarch hearers may
follow him to Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?” said
Dorothea, rather despising herself for having a secret motive in
asking the question.</p>
<p>“If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon,” said the old lady.
“I see that you set a right value on my son’s preaching. His
grandfather on my side was an excellent clergyman, but his father
was in the law:—most exemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a
reason for our never being rich. They say Fortune is a woman and
capricious. But sometimes she is a good woman and gives to those
who merit, which has been the case with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who
have given a living to my son.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified
satisfaction in her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not
what Dorothea wanted to hear. Poor thing! she did not even know
whether Will Ladislaw was still at Middlemarch, and there was no
one whom she dared to ask, unless it were Lydgate. But just now she
could not see Lydgate without sending for him or going to seek him.
Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having heard of that strange ban against him
left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it better that he and she should not
meet again, and perhaps she was wrong to wish for a meeting that
others might find many good reasons against. Still “I do wish it”
came at the end of those wise reflections as naturally as a sob
after holding the breath. And the meeting did happen, but in a
formal way quite unexpected by her.</p>
<p>One morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her boudoir
with a map of the land attached to the manor and other papers
before her, which were to help her in making an exact statement for
herself of her income and affairs. She had not yet applied herself
to her work, but was seated with her hands folded on her lap,
looking out along the avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every
leaf was at rest in the sunshine, the familiar scene was
changeless, and seemed to represent the prospect of her life, full
of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her own energy could not seek out
reasons for ardent action. The widow’s cap of those times made an
oval frame for the face, and had a crown standing up; the dress was
an experiment in the utmost laying on of crape; but this heavy
solemnity of clothing made her face look all the younger, with its
recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of her eyes.</p>
<p>Her reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr.
Ladislaw was below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were
not too early.</p>
<p>“I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be
shown into the drawing-room.”</p>
<p>The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to
her—the one least associated with the trials of her married life:
the damask matched the wood-work, which was all white and gold;
there were two tall mirrors and tables with nothing on them—in
brief, it was a room where you had no reason for sitting in one
place rather than in another. It was below the boudoir, and had
also a bow-window looking out on the avenue. But when Pratt showed
Will Ladislaw into it the window was open; and a winged visitor,
buzzing in and out now and then without minding the furniture, made
the room look less formal and uninhabited.</p>
<p>“Glad to see you here again, sir,” said Pratt, lingering to
adjust a blind.</p>
<p>“I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,” said Will, who wished
even the butler to know that he was too proud to hang about Mrs.
Casaubon now she was a rich widow.</p>
<p>“Very sorry to hear it, sir,” said Pratt, retiring. Of course,
as a servant who was to be told nothing, he knew the fact of which
Ladislaw was still ignorant, and had drawn his inferences; indeed,
had not differed from his betrothed Tantripp when she said, “Your
master was as jealous as a fiend—and no reason. Madam would look
higher than Mr. Ladislaw, else I don’t know her. Mrs. Cadwallader’s
maid says there’s a lord coming who is to marry her when the
mourning’s over.”</p>
<p>There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat
in his hand before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different
from that first meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and
Dorothea calm. This time he felt miserable but determined, while
she was in a state of agitation which could not be hidden. Just
outside the door she had felt that this longed-for meeting was
after all too difficult, and when she saw Will advancing towards
her, the deep blush which was rare in her came with painful
suddenness. Neither of them knew how it was, but neither of them
spoke. She gave her hand for a moment, and then they went to sit
down near the window, she on one settee and he on another opposite.
Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him not like Dorothea that
the mere fact of her being a widow should cause such a change in
her manner of receiving him; and he knew of no other condition
which could have affected their previous relation to each
other—except that, as his imagination at once told him, her friends
might have been poisoning her mind with their suspicions of
him.</p>
<p>“I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,” said Will; “I
could not bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life
without seeing you to say good-by.”</p>
<p>“Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you
had not wished to see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking
with perfect genuineness asserting itself through all her
uncertainty and agitation. “Are you going away immediately?”</p>
<p>“Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners
as a barrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all
public business. There will be a great deal of political work to be
done by-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have
managed to win an honorable position for themselves without family
or money.”</p>
<p>“And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea,
ardently. “Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my
uncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when
you leave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care
that justice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we
were in Rome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the
things that adorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you
think about the rest of the world.”</p>
<p>While she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal
embarrassment, and had become like her former self. She looked at
Will with a direct glance, full of delighted confidence.</p>
<p>“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming
here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said
Will, trying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost
effort to get an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.</p>
<p>She was not aware how long it was before she answered. She had
turned her head and was looking out of the window on the
rose-bushes, which seemed to have in them the summers of all the
years when Will would be away. This was not judicious behavior. But
Dorothea never thought of studying her manners: she thought only of
bowing to a sad necessity which divided her from Will. Those first
words of his about his intentions had seemed to make everything
clear to her: he knew, she supposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final
conduct in relation to him, and it had come to him with the same
sort of shock as to herself. He had never felt more than friendship
for her—had never had anything in his mind to justify what she felt
to be her husband’s outrage on the feelings of both: and that
friendship he still felt. Something which may be called an inward
silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she said with a pure
voice, just trembling in the last words as if only from its liquid
flexibility—</p>
<p>“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very
happy when I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must
have patience. It will perhaps be a long while.”</p>
<p>Will never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from
falling down at her feet, when the “long while” came forth with its
gentle tremor. He used to say that the horrible hue and surface of
her crape dress was most likely the sufficient controlling force.
He sat still, however, and only said—</p>
<p>“I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about
me.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Dorothea, ”I shall never forget you. I have never
forgotten any one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded,
and seems not likely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for
memory at Lowick, haven’t I?“ She smiled.</p>
<p>“Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat
still in his hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he
suddenly turned and leaned his back against it. The blood had
mounted to his face and neck, and he looked almost angry. It had
seemed to him as if they were like two creatures slowly turning to
marble in each other’s presence, while their hearts were conscious
and their eyes were yearning. But there was no help for it. It
should never be true of him that in this meeting to which he had
come with bitter resolution he had ended by a confession which
might be interpreted into asking for her fortune. Moreover, it was
actually true that he was fearful of the effect which such
confessions might have on Dorothea herself.</p>
<p>She looked at him from that distance in some trouble, imagining
that there might have been an offence in her words. But all the
while there was a current of thought in her about his probable want
of money, and the impossibility of her helping him. If her uncle
had been at home, something might have been done through him! It
was this preoccupation with the hardship of Will’s wanting money,
while she had what ought to have been his share, which led her to
say, seeing that he remained silent and looked away from her—</p>
<p>“I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which
hangs up-stairs—I mean that beautiful miniature of your
grandmother. I think it is not right for me to keep it, if you
would wish to have it. It is wonderfully like you.”</p>
<p>“You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind
about it. It is not very consoling to have one’s own likeness. It
would be more consoling if others wanted to have it.”</p>
<p>“I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—”
Dorothea broke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her
away from Aunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the
miniature as a family memorial.”</p>
<p>“Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with
only a portmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his
head.”</p>
<p>Will spoke at random: he was merely venting his petulance; it
was a little too exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait
offered him at that moment. But to Dorothea’s feeling his words had
a peculiar sting. She rose and said with a touch of indignation as
well as hauteur—</p>
<p>“You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have
nothing.”</p>
<p>Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed
like a dismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a
little way towards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange
questioning gravity. Something was keeping their minds aloof, and
each was left to conjecture what was in the other. Will had really
never thought of himself as having a claim of inheritance on the
property which was held by Dorothea, and would have required a
narrative to make him understand her present feeling.</p>
<p>“I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he
said. “But poverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from
what we most care for.”</p>
<p>The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent. She
answered in a tone of sad fellowship.</p>
<p>“Sorrow comes in so many ways. Two years ago I had no notion of
that—I mean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties
our hands, and makes us silent when we long to speak. I used to
despise women a little for not shaping their lives more, and doing
better things. I was very fond of doing as I liked, but I have
almost given it up,” she ended, smiling playfully.</p>
<p>“I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do
it,” said Will. He was standing two yards from her with his mind
full of contradictory desires and resolves—desiring some
unmistakable proof that she loved him, and yet dreading the
position into which such a proof might bring him. “The thing one
most longs for may be surrounded with conditions that would be
intolerable.”</p>
<p>At this moment Pratt entered and said, “Sir James Chettam is in
the library, madam.”</p>
<p>“Ask Sir James to come in here,” said Dorothea, immediately. It
was as if the same electric shock had passed through her and Will.
Each of them felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the
other, while they awaited Sir James’s entrance.</p>
<p>After shaking hands with Dorothea, he bowed as slightly as
possible to Ladislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then
going towards Dorothea, said—</p>
<p>“I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long
while.”</p>
<p>Dorothea put out her hand and said her good-by cordially. The
sense that Sir James was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to
him, roused her resolution and dignity: there was no touch of
confusion in her manner. And when Will had left the room, she
looked with such calm self-possession at Sir James, saying, “How is
Celia?” that he was obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed
him. And what would be the use of behaving otherwise? Indeed, Sir
James shrank with so much dislike from the association even in
thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw as her possible lover, that he
would himself have wished to avoid an outward show of displeasure
which would have recognized the disagreeable possibility. If any
one had asked him why he shrank in that way, I am not sure that he
would at first have said anything fuller or more precise than
“<i>That</i> Ladislaw!"—though on reflection he might have urged
that Mr. Casaubon's codicil, barring Dorothea's marriage with Will,
except under a penalty, was enough to cast unfitness over any
relation at all between them. His aversion was all the stronger
because he felt himself unable to interfere.</p>
<p>But Sir James was a power in a way unguessed by himself.
Entering at that moment, he was an incorporation of the strongest
reasons through which Will’s pride became a repellent force,
keeping him asunder from Dorothea.</p>
