<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">If</span> it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss
Brooke as a suitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce
her to accept him were already planted in her mind, and by the
evening of the next day the reasons had budded and bloomed. For
they had had a long conversation in the morning, while Celia, who
did not like the company of Mr. Casaubon's moles and sallowness,
had escaped to the vicarage to play with the curate's ill-shod but
merry children.</p>
<p>Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged
reservoir of Mr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague
labyrinthine extension every quality she herself brought; had
opened much of her own experience to him, and had understood from
him the scope of his great work, also of attractively labyrinthine
extent. For he had been as instructive as Milton’s “affable
archangel;“ and with something of the archangelic manner he told
her how he had undertaken to show (what indeed had been attempted
before, but not with that thoroughness, justice of comparison, and
effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr. Casaubon aimed) that all
the mythical systems or erratic mythical fragments in the world
were corruptions of a tradition originally revealed. Having once
mastered the true position and taken a firm footing there, the vast
field of mythical constructions became intelligible, nay, luminous
with the reflected light of correspondences. But to gather in this
great harvest of truth was no light or speedy work. His notes
already made a formidable range of volumes, but the crowning task
would be to condense these voluminous still-accumulating results
and bring them, like the earlier vintage of Hippocratic books, to
fit a little shelf. In explaining this to Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon
expressed himself nearly as he would have done to a fellow-student,
for he had not two styles of talking at command: it is true that
when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the English
with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in any
case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his
acquaintances as of ”lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi
men, that conne Latyn but lytille.“</p>
<p>Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this
conception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’
school literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would
reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern
Augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint.</p>
<p>The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning,
for when Dorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes
which she could speak of to no one whom she had before seen at
Tipton, especially on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical
forms and articles of belief compared with that spiritual religion,
that submergence of self in communion with Divine perfection which
seemed to her to be expressed in the best Christian books of widely
distant ages, she found in Mr. Casaubon a listener who understood
her at once, who could assure her of his own agreement with that
view when duly tempered with wise conformity, and could mention
historical examples before unknown to her.</p>
<p>“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he
thinks a whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny
mirror. And his feelings too, his whole experience—what a lake
compared with my little pool!”</p>
<p>Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less
unhesitatingly than other young ladies of her age. Signs are small
measurable things, but interpretations are illimitable, and in
girls of sweet, ardent nature, every sign is apt to conjure up
wonder, hope, belief, vast as a sky, and colored by a diffused
thimbleful of matter in the shape of knowledge. They are not always
too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself may have fallen by
good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning sometimes
lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way off
the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and
then arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was
hasty in her trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was
unworthy of it.</p>
<p>He stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight
pressure of invitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except
his own documents on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr.
Casaubon was called into the library to look at these in a heap,
while his host picked up first one and then the other to read aloud
from in a skipping and uncertain way, passing from one unfinished
passage to another with a “Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing
them all aside to open the journal of his youthful Continental
travels.</p>
<p>“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of
Rhamnus—you are a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have
given much study to the topography. I spent no end of time in
making out these things—Helicon, now. Here, now!—’We started the
next morning for Parnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this
volume is about Greece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his
thumb transversely along the edges of the leaves as he held the
book forward.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience;
bowed in the right place, and avoided looking at anything
documentary as far as possible, without showing disregard or
impatience; mindful that this desultoriness was associated with the
institutions of the country, and that the man who took him on this
severe mental scamper was not only an amiable host, but a
landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance aided also by
the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?</p>
<p>Certainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to
him, on drawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in
looking at her his face was often lit up by a smile like pale
wintry sunshine. Before he left the next morning, while taking a
pleasant walk with Miss Brooke along the gravelled terrace, he had
mentioned to her that he felt the disadvantage of loneliness, the
need of that cheerful companionship with which the presence of
youth can lighten or vary the serious toils of maturity. And he
delivered this statement with as much careful precision as if he
had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be attended with
results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that he should
have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or
personal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on
the 2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the
mention of that date; judging by the standard of his own memory,
which was a volume where a vide supra could serve instead of
repetitions, and not the ordinary long-used blotting-book which
only tells of forgotten writing. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s
confidence was not likely to be falsified, for Dorothea heard and
retained what he said with the eager interest of a fresh young
nature to which every variety in experience is an epoch.</p>
<p>It was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.
Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from
Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried
along the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander
through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than
that of Monk, the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of
the young ladies in their walks. There had risen before her the
girl’s vision of a possible future for herself to which she looked
forward with trembling hope, and she wanted to wander on in that
visionary future without interruption. She walked briskly in the
brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and her straw bonnet
(which our contemporaries might look at with conjectural curiosity
as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a little backward. She would
perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were omitted that she
wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind so as to
expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time when
public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be dissimulated
by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never surpassed by
any great race except the Feejeean. This was a trait of Miss
Brooke’s asceticism. But there was nothing of an ascetic’s
expression in her bright full eyes, as she looked before her, not
consciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her mood,
the solemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light
between the far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each
other.</p>
<p>All people, young or old (that is, all people in those
ante-reform times), would have thought her an interesting object if
they had referred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly
awakened ordinary images of young love: the illusions of Chloe
about Strephon have been sufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the
pathetic loveliness of all spontaneous trust ought to be. Miss
Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and dreaming along endless vistas of
unwearying companionship, was a little drama which never tired our
fathers and mothers, and had been put into all costumes. Let but
Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the disadvantages of the
shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it not only natural
but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a sweet girl
should be at once convinced of his virtue, his exceptional ability,
and above all, his perfect sincerity. But perhaps no persons then
living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had
a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions
about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm
about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its
own fire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the
pattern of plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the
blooming matron.</p>
<p>It had now entered Dorothea’s mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish
to make her his wife, and the idea that he would do so touched her
with a sort of reverential gratitude. How good of him—nay, it would
be almost as if a winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her
path and held out his hand towards her! For a long while she had
been oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a
thick summer haze, over all her desire to make her life greatly
effective. What could she do, what ought she to do?—she, hardly
more than a budding woman, but yet with an active conscience and a
great mental need, not to be satisfied by a girlish instruction
comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a discursive mouse.
With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she might have
thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find her
ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler
clergy, the perusal of “Female Scripture Characters,” unfolding the
private experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas
under the New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her
own boudoir—with a background of prospective marriage to a man who,
if less strict than herself, as being involved in affairs
religiously inexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably
exhorted. From such contentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The
intensity of her religious disposition, the coercion it exercised
over her life, was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent,
theoretic, and intellectually consequent: and with such a nature
struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching, hemmed in by a social
life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses, a
walled-in maze of small paths that led no whither, the outcome was
sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency.
The thing which seemed to her best, she wanted to justify by the
completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended admission of
rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as yet all
her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her was
one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own
ignorance, and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a
guide who would take her along the grandest path.</p>
<p>“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still
walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would
be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great
works. There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day
things with us would mean the greatest things. It would be like
marrying Pascal. I should learn to see the truth by the same light
as great men have seen it by. And then I should know what to do,
when I got older: I should see how it was possible to lead a grand
life here—now—in England. I don’t feel sure about doing good in any
way now: everything seems like going on a mission to a people whose
language I don’t know;—unless it were building good cottages—there
can be no doubt about that. Oh, I hope I should be able to get the
people well housed in Lowick! I will draw plenty of plans while I
have time.”</p>
<p>Dorothea checked herself suddenly with self-rebuke for the
presumptuous way in which she was reckoning on uncertain events,
but she was spared any inward effort to change the direction of her
thoughts by the appearance of a cantering horseman round a turning
of the road. The well-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful
setters could leave no doubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam.
He discerned Dorothea, jumped off his horse at once, and, having
delivered it to his groom, advanced towards her with something
white on his arm, at which the two setters were barking in an
excited manner.</p>
<p>“How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke,” he said, raising his
hat and showing his sleekly waving blond hair. “It has hastened the
pleasure I was looking forward to.”</p>
<p>Miss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable
baronet, really a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the
necessity of making himself agreeable to the elder sister. Even a
prospective brother-in-law may be an oppression if he will always
be presupposing too good an understanding with you, and agreeing
with you even when you contradict him. The thought that he had made
the mistake of paying his addresses to herself could not take
shape: all her mental activity was used up in persuasions of
another kind. But he was positively obtrusive at this moment, and
his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable. Her roused temper made
her color deeply, as she returned his greeting with some
haughtiness.</p>
<p>Sir James interpreted the heightened color in the way most
gratifying to himself, and thought he never saw Miss Brooke looking
so handsome.</p>
<p>“I have brought a little petitioner,” he said, “or rather, I
have brought him to see if he will be approved before his petition
is offered.” He showed the white object under his arm, which was a
tiny Maltese puppy, one of nature’s most naive toys.</p>
<p>“It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely
as pets,” said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming itself that very
moment (as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.</p>
<p>“Oh, why?” said Sir James, as they walked forward.</p>
<p>“I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them
happy. They are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel
or a mouse that gets its own living is more interesting. I like to
think that the animals about us have souls something like our own,
and either carry on their own little affairs or can be companions
to us, like Monk here. Those creatures are parasitic.”</p>
<p>“I am so glad I know that you do not like them,” said good Sir
James. “I should never keep them for myself, but ladies usually are
fond of these Maltese dogs. Here, John, take this dog, will
you?”</p>
<p>The objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black
and expressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that
it had better not have been born. But she felt it necessary to
explain.</p>
<p>“You must not judge of Celia’s feeling from mine. I think she
likes these small pets. She had a tiny terrier once, which she was
very fond of. It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading
on it. I am rather short-sighted.”</p>
<p>“You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it
is always a good opinion.”</p>
<p>What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?</p>
<p>“Do you know, I envy you that,” Sir James said, as they
continued walking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.</p>
<p>“I don’t quite understand what you mean.”</p>
<p>“Your power of forming an opinion. I can form an opinion of
persons. I know when I like people. But about other matters, do you
know, I have often a difficulty in deciding. One hears very
sensible things said on opposite sides.”</p>
<p>“Or that seem sensible. Perhaps we don’t always discriminate
between sense and nonsense.”</p>
<p>Dorothea felt that she was rather rude.</p>
<p>“Exactly,“ said Sir James. ”But you seem to have the power of
discrimination.“</p>
<p>“On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from
ignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am
unable to see it.”</p>
<p>“I think there are few who would see it more readily. Do you
know, Lovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best
notion in the world of a plan for cottages—quite wonderful for a
young lady, he thought. You had a real <i>genus</i>, to use his
expression. He said you wanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of
cottages, but he seemed to think it hardly probable that your uncle
would consent. Do you know, that is one of the things I wish to
do—I mean, on my own estate. I should be so glad to carry out that
plan of yours, if you would let me see it. Of course, it is sinking
money; that is why people object to it. Laborers can never pay rent
to make it answer. But, after all, it is worth doing."</p>
<p>“Worth doing! yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, energetically,
forgetting her previous small vexations. “I think we deserve to be
beaten out of our beautiful houses with a scourge of small
cords—all of us who let tenants live in such sties as we see round
us. Life in cottages might be happier than ours, if they were real
houses fit for human beings from whom we expect duties and
affections.”</p>
<p>“Will you show me your plan?”</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly. I dare say it is very faulty. But I have been
examining all the plans for cottages in Loudon’s book, and picked
out what seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to
set the pattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate,
we should put the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.”</p>
<p>Dorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother
in-law, building model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps,
others being built at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in
imitation—it would be as if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over
the parishes to make the life of poverty beautiful!</p>
<p>Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon
with Lovegood. He also took away a complacent sense that he was
making great progress in Miss Brooke’s good opinion. The Maltese
puppy was not offered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea
afterwards thought of with surprise; but she blamed herself for it.
She had been engrossing Sir James. After all, it was a relief that
there was no puppy to tread upon.</p>
<p>Celia was present while the plans were being examined, and
observed Sir James’s illusion. “He thinks that Dodo cares about
him, and she only cares about her plans. Yet I am not certain that
she would refuse him if she thought he would let her manage
everything and carry out all her notions. And how very
uncomfortable Sir James would be! I cannot bear notions.”</p>
<p>It was Celia’s private luxury to indulge in this dislike. She
dared not confess it to her sister in any direct statement, for
that would be laying herself open to a demonstration that she was
somehow or other at war with all goodness. But on safe
opportunities, she had an indirect mode of making her negative
wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her down from her rhapsodic
mood by reminding her that people were staring, not listening.
Celia was not impulsive: what she had to say could wait, and came
from her always with the same quiet staccato evenness. When people
talked with energy and emphasis she watched their faces and
features merely. She never could understand how well-bred persons
consented to sing and open their mouths in the ridiculous manner
requisite for that vocal exercise.</p>
<p>It was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit,
on which he was invited again for the following week to dine and
stay the night. Thus Dorothea had three more conversations with
him, and was convinced that her first impressions had been just. He
was all she had at first imagined him to be: almost everything he
had said seemed like a specimen from a mine, or the inscription on
the door of a museum which might open on the treasures of past
ages; and this trust in his mental wealth was all the deeper and
more effective on her inclination because it was now obvious that
his visits were made for her sake. This accomplished man
condescended to think of a young girl, and take the pains to talk
to her, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to her
understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What
delightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that
trivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of
heavy men which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth
with an odor of cupboard. He talked of what he was interested in,
or else he was silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this
was adorable genuineness, and religious abstinence from that
artificiality which uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence.
For she looked as reverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation
above herself as she did at his intellect and learning. He assented
to her expressions of devout feeling, and usually with an
appropriate quotation; he allowed himself to say that he had gone
through some spiritual conflicts in his youth; in short, Dorothea
saw that here she might reckon on understanding, sympathy, and
guidance. On one—only one—of her favorite themes she was
disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about building
cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow
accommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient
Egyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,
Dorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and
her mind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying
conditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the
admitted wickedness of pagan despots. Should she not urge these
arguments on Mr. Casaubon when he came again? But further
reflection told her that she was presumptuous in demanding his
attention to such a subject; he would not disapprove of her
occupying herself with it in leisure moments, as other women
expected to occupy themselves with their dress and embroidery—would
not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she detected
herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been invited to go
to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose
that Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke’s society for its own
sake, either with or without documents?</p>
<p>Meanwhile that little disappointment made her delight the more
in Sir James Chettam’s readiness to set on foot the desired
improvements. He came much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea
ceased to find him disagreeable since he showed himself so entirely
in earnest; for he had already entered with much practical ability
into Lovegood’s estimates, and was charmingly docile. She proposed
to build a couple of cottages, and transfer two families from their
old cabins, which could then be pulled down, so that new ones could
be built on the old sites. Sir James said “Exactly,“ and she bore
the word remarkably well.</p>
<p>Certainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be
very useful members of society under good feminine direction, if
they were fortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It is
difficult to say whether there was or was not a little wilfulness
in her continuing blind to the possibility that another sort of
choice was in question in relation to her. But her life was just
now full of hope and action: she was not only thinking of her
plans, but getting down learned books from the library and reading
many things hastily (that she might be a little less ignorant in
talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited with
conscientious questionings whether she were not exalting these poor
doings above measure and contemplating them with that
self-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and
folly.</p>
