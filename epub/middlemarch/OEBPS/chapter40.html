<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">In</span> watching effects, if only of an electric battery, it is often
necessary to change our place and examine a particular mixture or
group at some distance from the point where the movement we are
interested in was set up. The group I am moving towards is at Caleb
Garth's breakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk
were: father, mother, and five of the children. Mary was just now
at home waiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to
her, was getting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having
to his father's disappointment taken to books instead of that
sacred calling "business."</p>
<p>The letters had come—nine costly letters, for which the postman
had been paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his
tea and toast while he read his letters and laid them open one
above the other, sometimes swaying his head slowly, sometimes
screwing up his mouth in inward debate, but not forgetting to cut
off a large red seal unbroken, which Letty snatched up like an
eager terrier.</p>
<p>The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing
disturbed Caleb’s absorption except shaking the table when he was
writing.</p>
<p>Two letters of the nine had been for Mary. After reading them,
she had passed them to her mother, and sat playing with her
tea-spoon absently, till with a sudden recollection she returned to
her sewing, which she had kept on her lap during breakfast.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t sew, Mary!” said Ben, pulling her arm down. “Make me
a peacock with this bread-crumb.” He had been kneading a small mass
for the purpose.</p>
<p>“No, no, Mischief!” said Mary, good-humoredly, while she pricked
his hand lightly with her needle. “Try and mould it yourself: you
have seen me do it often enough. I must get this sewing done. It is
for Rosamond Vincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t
be married without this handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused
with the last notion.</p>
<p>“Why can’t she, Mary?” said Letty, seriously interested in this
mystery, and pushing her head so close to her sister that Mary now
turned the threatening needle towards Letty’s nose.</p>
<p>“Because this is one of a dozen, and without it there would only
be eleven,” said Mary, with a grave air of explanation, so that
Letty sank back with a sense of knowledge.</p>
<p>“Have you made up your mind, my dear?” said Mrs. Garth, laying
the letters down.</p>
<p>“I shall go to the school at York,” said Mary. “I am less unfit
to teach in a school than in a family. I like to teach classes
best. And, you see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be
done.”</p>
<p>“Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world,”
said Mrs. Garth, with a touch of rebuke in her tone. “I could
understand your objection to it if you had not knowledge enough,
Mary, or if you disliked children.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what
we like, mother,” said Mary, rather curtly. “I am not fond of a
schoolroom: I like the outside world better. It is a very
inconvenient fault of mine.”</p>
<p>“It must be very stupid to be always in a girls’ school,” said
Alfred. “Such a set of nincompoops, like Mrs. Ballard’s pupils
walking two and two.”</p>
<p>“And they have no games worth playing at,” said Jim. “They can
neither throw nor leap. I don’t wonder at Mary’s not liking
it.”</p>
<p>“What is that Mary doesn’t like, eh?” said the father, looking
over his spectacles and pausing before he opened his next
letter.</p>
<p>“Being among a lot of nincompoop girls,” said Alfred.</p>
<p>“Is it the situation you had heard of, Mary?” said Caleb,
gently, looking at his daughter.</p>
<p>“Yes, father: the school at York. I have determined to take it.
It is quite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for
teaching the smallest strummers at the piano.”</p>
<p>“Poor child! I wish she could stay at home with us, Susan,” said
Caleb, looking plaintively at his wife.</p>
<p>“Mary would not be happy without doing her duty,” said Mrs.
Garth, magisterially, conscious of having done her own.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t make me happy to do such a nasty duty as that,”
said Alfred—at which Mary and her father laughed silently, but Mrs.
Garth said, gravely—</p>
<p>“Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for
everything that you think disagreeable. And suppose that Mary could
help you to go to Mr. Hanmer’s with the money she gets?”</p>
<p>“That seems to me a great shame. But she’s an old brick,” said
Alfred, rising from his chair, and pulling Mary’s head backward to
kiss her.</p>
<p>Mary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears
were coming. Caleb, looking on over his spectacles, with the angles
of his eyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and
sorrow as he returned to the opening of his letter; and even Mrs.
Garth, her lips curling with a calm contentment, allowed that
inappropriate language to pass without correction, although Ben
immediately took it up, and sang, “She’s an old brick, old brick,
old brick!” to a cantering measure, which he beat out with his fist
on Mary’s arm.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Garth’s eyes were now drawn towards her husband, who
was already deep in the letter he was reading. His face had an
expression of grave surprise, which alarmed her a little, but he
did not like to be questioned while he was reading, and she
remained anxiously watching till she saw him suddenly shaken by a
little joyous laugh as he turned back to the beginning of the
letter, and looking at her above his spectacles, said, in a low
tone, “What do you think, Susan?”</p>
<p>She went and stood behind him, putting her hand on his shoulder,
while they read the letter together. It was from Sir James Chettam,
offering to Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at
Freshitt and elsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been
requested by Mr. Brooke of Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth
would be disposed at the same time to resume the agency of the
Tipton property. The Baronet added in very obliging words that he
himself was particularly desirous of seeing the Freshitt and Tipton
estates under the same management, and he hoped to be able to show
that the double agency might be held on terms agreeable to Mr.
Garth, whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at twelve o’clock
on the following day.</p>
<p>“He writes handsomely, doesn’t he, Susan?” said Caleb, turning
his eyes upward to his wife, who raised her hand from his shoulder
to his ear, while she rested her chin on his head. “Brooke didn’t
like to ask me himself, I can see,” he continued, laughing
silently.</p>
<p>“Here is an honor to your father, children,” said Mrs. Garth,
looking round at the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents.
“He is asked to take a post again by those who dismissed him long
ago. That shows that he did his work well, so that they feel the
want of him.”</p>
<p>“Like Cincinnatus—hooray!” said Ben, riding on his chair, with a
pleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.</p>
<p>“Will they come to fetch him, mother?” said Letty, thinking of
the Mayor and Corporation in their robes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garth patted Letty’s head and smiled, but seeing that her
husband was gathering up his letters and likely soon to be out of
reach in that sanctuary “business,“ she pressed his shoulder and
said emphatically—</p>
<p>“Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would
be unreasonable to suppose anything else of him. “It’ll come to
between four and five hundred, the two together.” Then with a
little start of remembrance he said, “Mary, write and give up that
school. Stay and help your mother. I’m as pleased as Punch, now
I’ve thought of that.”</p>
<p>No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant
than Caleb’s, but his talents did not lie in finding phrases,
though he was very particular about his letter-writing, and
regarded his wife as a treasury of correct language.</p>
<p>There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held
up the cambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it
might be put out of reach while the boys dragged her into a dance.
Mrs. Garth, in placid joy, began to put the cups and plates
together, while Caleb pushing his chair from the table, as if he
were going to move to the desk, still sat holding his letters in
his hand and looking on the ground meditatively, stretching out the
fingers of his left hand, according to a mute language of his own.
At last he said—</p>
<p>“It’s a thousand pities Christy didn’t take to business, Susan.
I shall want help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the
engineering—I’ve made up my mind to that.” He fell into meditation
and finger-rhetoric again for a little while, and then continued:
“I shall make Brooke have new agreements with the tenants, and I
shall draw up a rotation of crops. And I’ll lay a wager we can get
fine bricks out of the clay at Bott’s corner. I must look into
that: it would cheapen the repairs. It’s a fine bit of work, Susan!
A man without a family would be glad to do it for nothing.”</p>
<p>“Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her
finger.</p>
<p>“No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen
into the nature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of
the country into good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the
right way with their farming, and getting a bit of good contriving
and solid building done—that those who are living and those who
come after will be the better for. I’d sooner have it than a
fortune. I hold it the most honorable work that is.” Here Caleb
laid down his letters, thrust his fingers between the buttons of
his waistcoat, and sat upright, but presently proceeded with some
awe in his voice and moving his head slowly aside—“It’s a great
gift of God, Susan.”</p>
<p>“That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And
it will be a blessing to your children to have had a father who did
such work: a father whose good work remains though his name may be
forgotten.” She could not say any more to him then about the
pay.</p>
<p>In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work,
was seated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while
Mrs. Garth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was
whispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the
orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with
the tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was
fond of his parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth
mentioning to Lydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s
privilege of disregarding the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks,
and always told his mother that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than
any matron in the town. Still, you see, he spent his evenings at
the Vincys’, where the matron, though less of a lady, presided over
a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In those days human intercourse
was not determined solely by respect. But the Vicar did heartily
respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no surprise to that
family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he was shaking
hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have something
to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is, poor
fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with
his bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has
taken me into his confidence.”</p>
<p>Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s
confidence had gone.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t
think what was become of him.”</p>
<p>“He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was
a little too hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor
fellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he came and
poured himself out to me. I am very glad he did, because I have
seen him grow up from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at
home in the house that the children are like nephews and nieces to
me. But it is a difficult case to advise upon. However, he has
asked me to come and tell you that he is going away, and that he is
so miserable about his debt to you, and his inability to pay, that
he can’t bear to come himself even to bid you good by.”</p>
<p>“Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his
hand. “We’ve had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going
to be as rich as a Jew.”</p>
<p>“Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we
are going to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary
at home.”</p>
<p>“What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p>“I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and
perhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all
the same family connection, and employment spreads like water if
it’s once set going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here
Caleb threw back his head a little, and spread his arms on the
elbows of his chair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again with the
letting of the land, and carrying out a notion or two with
improvements. It’s a most uncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often
told Susan, to sit on horseback and look over the hedges at the
wrong thing, and not be able to put your hand to it to make it
right. What people do who go into politics I can’t think: it drives
me almost mad to see mismanagement over only a few hundred
acres.”</p>
<p>It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his
happiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and
the words came without effort.</p>
<p>“I congratulate you heartily, Garth,” said the Vicar. “This is
the best sort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for
he dwelt a good deal on the injury he had done you in causing you
to part with money—robbing you of it, he said—which you wanted for
other purposes. I wish Fred were not such an idle dog; he has some
very good points, and his father is a little hard upon him.”</p>
<p>“Where is he going?” said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.</p>
<p>“He means to try again for his degree, and he is going up to
study before term. I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him
to enter the Church—on the contrary. But if he will go and work so
as to pass, that will be some guarantee that he has energy and a
will; and he is quite at sea; he doesn’t know what else to do. So
far he will please his father, and I have promised in the mean time
to try and reconcile Vincy to his son’s adopting some other line of
life. Fred says frankly he is not fit for a clergyman, and I would
do anything I could to hinder a man from the fatal step of choosing
the wrong profession. He quoted to me what you said, Miss Garth—do
you remember it?” (Mr. Farebrother used to say “Mary“ instead of
”Miss Garth,“ but it was part of his delicacy to treat her with the
more deference because, according to Mrs. Vincy’s phrase, she
worked for her bread.)</p>
<p>Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter
lightly, answered at once, “I have said so many impertinent things
to Fred—we are such old playfellows.”</p>
<p>“You said, according to him, that he would be one of those
ridiculous clergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous.
Really, that was so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.”</p>
<p>Caleb laughed. “She gets her tongue from you, Susan,” he said,
with some enjoyment.</p>
<p>“Not its flippancy, father,” said Mary, quickly, fearing that
her mother would be displeased. “It is rather too bad of Fred to
repeat my flippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.”</p>
<p>“It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear,” said Mrs. Garth,
with whom speaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor. “We
should not value our Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous
curate in the next parish.”</p>
<p>“There’s something in what she says, though,” said Caleb, not
disposed to have Mary’s sharpness undervalued. “A bad workman of
any sort makes his fellows mistrusted. Things hang together,” he
added, looking on the floor and moving his feet uneasily with a
sense that words were scantier than thoughts.</p>
<p>“Clearly,“ said the Vicar, amused. ”By being contemptible we set
men’s minds, to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss
Garth’s view of the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not.
But as to Fred Vincy, it is only fair he should be excused a
little: old Featherstone’s delusive behavior did help to spoil him.
There was something quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing
after all. But Fred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And
what he cares most about is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he
supposes you will never think well of him again.“</p>
<p>“I have been disappointed in Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, with
decision. “But I shall be ready to think well of him again when he
gives me good reason to do so.”</p>
<p>At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with
her.</p>
<p>“Oh, we must forgive young people when they’re sorry,” said
Caleb, watching Mary close the door. “And as you say, Mr.
Farebrother, there was the very devil in that old man.”</p>
<p>Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell you a thing—it’s only known to
Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it again. The old scoundrel
wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very night he died, when
she was sitting up with him by herself, and he offered her a sum of
money that he had in the box by him if she would do it. But Mary,
you understand, could do no such thing—would not be handling his
iron chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he wanted burnt was
this last, so that if Mary had done what he wanted, Fred Vincy
would have had ten thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him at
the last. That touches poor Mary close; she couldn’t help it—she
was in the right to do what she did, but she feels, as she says,
much as if she had knocked down somebody’s property and broken it
against her will, when she was rightfully defending herself. I feel
with her, somehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad,
instead of bearing him a grudge for the harm he did us, I should be
glad to do it. Now, what is your opinion, sir? Susan doesn’t agree
with me. She says—tell what you say, Susan.“</p>
<p>“Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she had known what
would be the effect on Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, pausing from her
work, and looking at Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p>“And she was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which
falls on another because we have done right is not to lie upon our
conscience.”</p>
<p>The Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, “It’s the
feeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her. You
don’t mean your horse to tread on a dog when you’re backing out of
the way; but it goes through you, when it’s done.”</p>
<p>“I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,” said Mr.
Farebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate
than to speak. “One could hardly say that the feeling you mention
about Fred is wrong—or rather, mistaken—though no man ought to make
a claim on such feeling.”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said Caleb, “it’s a secret. You will not tell
Fred.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not. But I shall carry the other good news—that you
can afford the loss he caused you.”</p>
<p>Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in
the orchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her. They made a
pretty picture in the western light which brought out the
brightness of the apples on the old scant-leaved boughs—Mary in her
lavender gingham and black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in
her well-worn nankin picked up the fallen apples. If you want to
know more particularly how Mary looked, ten to one you will see a
face like hers in the crowded street to-morrow, if you are there on
the watch: she will not be among those daughters of Zion who are
haughty, and walk with stretched-out necks and wanton eyes, mincing
as they go: let all those pass, and fix your eyes on some small
plump brownish person of firm but quiet carriage, who looks about
her, but does not suppose that anybody is looking at her. If she
has a broad face and square brow, well-marked eyebrows and curly
dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her glance which
her mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features entirely
insignificant—take that ordinary but not disagreeable person for a
portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her smile, she would show you
perfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise
her voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you
have ever tasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she
would never forget it. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little
Vicar in his well-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she
had had the opportunity of knowing. She had never heard him say a
foolish thing, though she knew that he did unwise ones; and perhaps
foolish sayings were more objectionable to her than any of Mr.
Farebrother’s unwise doings. At least, it was remarkable that the
actual imperfections of the Vicar’s clerical character never seemed
to call forth the same scorn and dislike which she showed
beforehand for the predicted imperfections of the clerical
character sustained by Fred Vincy. These irregularities of
judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds than Mary
Garth’s: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and demerit,
which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which of
those widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman’s
tenderness?—the one she was most inclined to be severe on, or the
contrary?</p>
<p>“Have you any message for your old playfellow, Miss Garth?” said
the Vicar, as he took a fragrant apple from the basket which she
held towards him, and put it in his pocket. “Something to soften
down that harsh judgment? I am going straight to see him.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Mary, shaking her head, and smiling. ”If I were to
say that he would not be ridiculous as a clergyman, I must say that
he would be something worse than ridiculous. But I am very glad to
hear that he is going away to work.“</p>
<p>“On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that <i>you</i> are
not going away to work. My mother, I am sure, will be all the
happier if you will come to see her at the vicarage: you know she
is fond of having young people to talk to, and she has a great deal
to tell about old times. You will really be doing a kindness."</p>
<p>“I should like it very much, if I may,” said Mary. “Everything
seems too happy for me all at once. I thought it would always be
part of my life to long for home, and losing that grievance makes
me feel rather empty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill
up my mind?”</p>
<p>“May I go with you, Mary?” whispered Letty—a most inconvenient
child, who listened to everything. But she was made exultant by
having her chin pinched and her cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother—an
incident which she narrated to her mother and father.</p>
<p>As the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching him closely
might have seen him twice shrug his shoulders. I think that the
rare Englishmen who have this gesture are never of the heavy
type—for fear of any lumbering instance to the contrary, I will
say, hardly ever; they have usually a fine temperament and much
tolerance towards the smaller errors of men (themselves inclusive).
The Vicar was holding an inward dialogue in which he told himself
that there was probably something more between Fred and Mary Garth
than the regard of old playfellows, and replied with a question
whether that bit of womanhood were not a great deal too choice for
that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to this was the first
shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely to have felt
jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which, added he, it
is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon followed
the second shrug.</p>
<p>What could two men, so different from each other, see in this
“brown patch,” as Mary called herself? It was certainly not her
plainness that attracted them (and let all plain young ladies be
warned against the dangerous encouragement given them by Society to
confide in their want of beauty). A human being in this aged nation
of ours is a very wonderful whole, the slow creation of long
interchanging influences: and charm is a result of two such wholes,
the one loving and the one loved.</p>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, “Susan,
guess what I’m thinking of.”</p>
<p>“The rotation of crops,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at him, above
her knitting, “or else the back-doors of the Tipton cottages.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Caleb, gravely; ”I am thinking that I could do a
great turn for Fred Vincy. Christy’s gone, Alfred will be gone
soon, and it will be five years before Jim is ready to take to
business. I shall want help, and Fred might come in and learn the
nature of things and act under me, and it might be the making of
him into a useful man, if he gives up being a parson. What do you
think?“</p>
<p>“I think, there is hardly anything honest that his family would
object to more,” said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.</p>
<p>“What care I about their objecting?” said Caleb, with a
sturdiness which he was apt to show when he had an opinion. “The
lad is of age and must get his bread. He has sense enough and
quickness enough; he likes being on the land, and it’s my belief
that he could learn business well if he gave his mind to it.”</p>
<p>“But would he? His father and mother wanted him to be a fine
gentleman, and I think he has the same sort of feeling himself.
They all think us beneath them. And if the proposal came from you,
I am sure Mrs. Vincy would say that we wanted Fred for Mary.”</p>
<p>“Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that
sort,” said Caleb, with disgust.</p>
<p>“Yes, but there is a certain pride which is proper, Caleb.”</p>
<p>“I call it improper pride to let fools’ notions hinder you from
doing a good action. There’s no sort of work,” said Caleb, with
fervor, putting out his hand and moving it up and down to mark his
emphasis, “that could ever be done well, if you minded what fools
say. You must have it inside you that your plan is right, and that
plan you must follow.”</p>
<p>“I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb,”
said Mrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were
some points on which her mild husband was yet firmer. “Still, it
seems to be fixed that Fred is to go back to college: will it not
be better to wait and see what he will choose to do after that? It
is not easy to keep people against their will. And you are not yet
quite sure enough of your own position, or what you will want.”</p>
<p>“Well, it may be better to wait a bit. But as to my getting
plenty of work for two, I’m pretty sure of that. I’ve always had my
hands full with scattered things, and there’s always something
fresh turning up. Why, only yesterday—bless me, I don’t think I
told you!—it was rather odd that two men should have been at me on
different sides to do the same bit of valuing. And who do you think
they were?” said Caleb, taking a pinch of snuff and holding it up
between his fingers, as if it were a part of his exposition. He was
fond of a pinch when it occurred to him, but he usually forgot that
this indulgence was at his command.</p>
<p>His wife held down her knitting and looked attentive.</p>
<p>“Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one. But Bulstrode
was before him, so I’m going to do it for Bulstrode. Whether it’s
mortgage or purchase they’re going for, I can’t tell yet.”</p>
<p>“Can that man be going to sell the land just left him—which he
has taken the name for?” said Mrs. Garth.</p>
<p>“Deuce knows,” said Caleb, who never referred the knowledge of
discreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce. “But
Bulstrode has long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under
his fingers—that I know. And it’s a difficult matter to get, in
this part of the country.”</p>
<p>Caleb scattered his snuff carefully instead of taking it, and
then added, “The ins and outs of things are curious. Here is the
land they’ve been all along expecting for Fred, which it seems the
old man never meant to leave him a foot of, but left it to this
side-slip of a son that he kept in the dark, and thought of his
sticking there and vexing everybody as well as he could have vexed
’em himself if he could have kept alive. I say, it would be curious
if it got into Bulstrode’s hands after all. The old man hated him,
and never would bank with him.”</p>
<p>“What reason could the miserable creature have for hating a man
whom he had nothing to do with?” said Mrs. Garth.</p>
<p>“Pooh! where’s the use of asking for such fellows’ reasons? The
soul of man,” said Caleb, with the deep tone and grave shake of the
head which always came when he used this phrase—“The soul of man,
when it gets fairly rotten, will bear you all sorts of poisonous
toad-stools, and no eye can see whence came the seed thereof.”</p>
<p>It was one of Caleb’s quaintnesses, that in his difficulty of
finding speech for his thought, he caught, as it were, snatches of
diction which he associated with various points of view or states
of mind; and whenever he had a feeling of awe, he was haunted by a
sense of Biblical phraseology, though he could hardly have given a
strict quotation.</p>
