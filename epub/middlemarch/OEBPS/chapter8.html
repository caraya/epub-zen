<blockquote><p>
          “Oh, rescue her!  I am her brother now,
          And you her father.  Every gentle maid
          Should have a guardian in each gentleman.”
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">It</span> was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well he continued to
like going to the Grange after he had once encountered the
difficulty of seeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a
woman who was engaged to another man. Of course the forked
lightning seemed to pass through him when he first approached her,
and he remained conscious throughout the interview of hiding
uneasiness; but, good as he was, it must be owned that his
uneasiness was less than it would have been if he had thought his
rival a brilliant and desirable match. He had no sense of being
eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that Dorothea was
under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost some of its
bitterness by being mingled with compassion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while Sir James said to himself that he had
completely resigned her, since with the perversity of a Desdemona
she had not affected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and
according to nature; he could not yet be quite passive under the
idea of her engagement to Mr. Casaubon. On the day when he first
saw them together in the light of his present knowledge, it seemed
to him that he had not taken the affair seriously enough. Brooke
was really culpable; he ought to have hindered it. Who could speak
to him? Something might be done perhaps even now, at least to defer
the marriage. On his way home he turned into the Rectory and asked
for Mr. Cadwallader. Happily, the Rector was at home, and his
visitor was shown into the study, where all the fishing tackle
hung. But he himself was in a little room adjoining, at work with
his turning apparatus, and he called to the baronet to join him
there. The two were better friends than any other landholder and
clergyman in the county—a significant fact which was in agreement
with the amiable expression of their faces.</p>
<p>Mr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet
smile; very plain and rough in his exterior, but with that solid
imperturbable ease and good-humor which is infectious, and like
great grassy hills in the sunshine, quiets even an irritated
egoism, and makes it rather ashamed of itself. “Well, how are you?”
he said, showing a hand not quite fit to be grasped. “Sorry I
missed you before. Is there anything particular? You look
vexed.”</p>
<p>Sir James’s brow had a little crease in it, a little depression
of the eyebrow, which he seemed purposely to exaggerate as he
answered.</p>
<p>“It is only this conduct of Brooke’s. I really think somebody
should speak to him.”</p>
<p>“What? meaning to stand?” said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with
the arrangement of the reels which he had just been turning. “I
hardly think he means it. But where’s the harm, if he likes it? Any
one who objects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don’t put
up the strongest fellow. They won’t overturn the Constitution with
our friend Brooke’s head for a battering ram.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that,” said Sir James, who, after putting down
his hat and throwing himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his
leg and examine the sole of his boot with much bitterness. “I mean
this marriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry
Casaubon.”</p>
<p>“What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in him—if the
girl likes him.”</p>
<p>“She is too young to know what she likes. Her guardian ought to
interfere. He ought not to allow the thing to be done in this
headlong manner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader—a man with
daughters, can look at the affair with indifference: and with such
a heart as yours! Do think seriously about it.”</p>
<p>“I am not joking; I am as serious as possible,” said the Rector,
with a provoking little inward laugh. “You are as bad as Elinor.
She has been wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have
reminded her that her friends had a very poor opinion of the match
she made when she married me.”</p>
<p>“But look at Casaubon,” said Sir James, indignantly. “He must be
fifty, and I don’t believe he could ever have been much more than
the shadow of a man. Look at his legs!”</p>
<p>“Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all
your own way in the world. You don’t under stand women. They don’t
admire you half so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to
tell her sisters that she married me for my ugliness—it was so
various and amusing that it had quite conquered her prudence.”</p>
<p>“You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no
question of beauty. I don’t <i>like</i> Casaubon." This was Sir
James's strongest way of implying that he thought ill of a man's
character.</p>
<p>“Why? what do you know against him?” said the Rector laying down
his reels, and putting his thumbs into his armholes with an air of
attention.</p>
<p>Sir James paused. He did not usually find it easy to give his
reasons: it seemed to him strange that people should not know them
without being told, since he only felt what was reasonable. At last
he said—</p>
<p>“Now, Cadwallader, has he got any heart?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes. I don’t mean of the melting sort, but a sound
kernel, <i>that</i> you may be sure of. He is very good to his poor
relations: pensions several of the women, and is educating a young
fellow at a good deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to his sense of
justice. His mother's sister made a bad match—a Pole, I think—lost
herself—at any rate was disowned by her family. If it had not been
for that, Casaubon would not have had so much money by half. I
believe he went himself to find out his cousins, and see what he
could do for them. Every man would not ring so well as that, if you
tried his metal. <i>You</i> would, Chettam; but not every man."</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Sir James, coloring. “I am not so sure of
myself.” He paused a moment, and then added, “That was a right
thing for Casaubon to do. But a man may wish to do what is right,
and yet be a sort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with
him. And I think when a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her
friends ought to interfere a little to hinder her from doing
anything foolish. You laugh, because you fancy I have some feeling
on my own account. But upon my honor, it is not that. I should feel
just the same if I were Miss Brooke’s brother or uncle.”</p>
<p>“Well, but what should you do?”</p>
<p>“I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she
was of age. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come
off. I wish you saw it as I do—I wish you would talk to Brooke
about it.”</p>
<p>Sir James rose as he was finishing his sentence, for he saw Mrs.
Cadwallader entering from the study. She held by the hand her
youngest girl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa,
and was made comfortable on his knee.</p>
<p>“I hear what you are talking about,” said the wife. “But you
will make no impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to
his bait, everybody is what he ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has
got a trout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself:
could there be a better fellow?”</p>
<p>“Well, there is something in that,” said the Rector, with his
quiet, inward laugh. “It is a very good quality in a man to have a
trout-stream.”</p>
<p>“But seriously,” said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet
spent itself, “don’t you think the Rector might do some good by
speaking?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I told you beforehand what he would say,” answered Mrs.
Cadwallader, lifting up her eyebrows. “I have done what I could: I
wash my hands of the marriage.”</p>
<p>“In the first place,” said the Rector, looking rather grave, “it
would be nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and
make him act accordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy;
he will run into any mould, but he won’t keep shape.”</p>
<p>“He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,” said
Sir James.</p>
<p>“But, my dear Chettam, why should I use my influence to
Casaubon’s disadvantage, unless I were much surer than I am that I
should be acting for the advantage of Miss Brooke? I know no harm
of Casaubon. I don’t care about his Xisuthrus and Fee-fo-fum and
the rest; but then he doesn’t care about my fishing-tackle. As to
the line he took on the Catholic Question, that was unexpected; but
he has always been civil to me, and I don’t see why I should spoil
his sport. For anything I can tell, Miss Brooke may be happier with
him than she would be with any other man.”</p>
<p>“Humphrey! I have no patience with you. You know you would
rather dine under the hedge than with Casaubon alone. You have
nothing to say to each other.”</p>
<p>“What has that to do with Miss Brooke’s marrying him? She does
not do it for my amusement.”</p>
<p>“He has got no good red blood in his body,” said Sir James.</p>
<p>“No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all
semicolons and parentheses,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.</p>
<p>“Why does he not bring out his book, instead of marrying,” said
Sir James, with a disgust which he held warranted by the sound
feeling of an English layman.</p>
<p>“Oh, he dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his brains.
They say, when he was a little boy, he made an abstract of ’Hop o’
my Thumb,’ and he has been making abstracts ever since. Ugh! And
that is the man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy
with.”</p>
<p>“Well, he is what Miss Brooke likes,” said the Rector. “I don’t
profess to understand every young lady’s taste.”</p>
<p>“But if she were your own daughter?” said Sir James.</p>
<p>“That would be a different affair. She is <i>not</i> my
daughter, and I don't feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as
good as most of us. He is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to
the cloth. Some Radical fellow speechifying at Middlemarch said
Casaubon was the learned straw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was
the brick-and-mortar incumbent, and I was the angling incumbent.
And upon my word, I don't see that one is worse or better than the
other." The Rector ended with his silent laugh. He always saw the
joke of any satire against himself. His conscience was large and
easy, like the rest of him: it did only what it could do without
any trouble.</p>
<p>Clearly, there would be no interference with Miss Brooke’s
marriage through Mr. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some
sadness that she was to have perfect liberty of misjudgment. It was
a sign of his good disposition that he did not slacken at all in
his intention of carrying out Dorothea’s design of the cottages.
Doubtless this persistence was the best course for his own dignity:
but pride only helps us to be generous; it never makes us so, any
more than vanity makes us witty. She was now enough aware of Sir
James’s position with regard to her, to appreciate the rectitude of
his perseverance in a landlord’s duty, to which he had at first
been urged by a lover’s complaisance, and her pleasure in it was
great enough to count for something even in her present happiness.
Perhaps she gave to Sir James Chettam’s cottages all the interest
she could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the symphony of
hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self devotion which
that learned gentleman had set playing in her soul. Hence it
happened that in the good baronet’s succeeding visits, while he was
beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he found himself
talking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. She was perfectly
unconstrained and without irritation towards him now, and he was
gradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and
companionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide
or confess.</p>
