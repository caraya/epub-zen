<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">At</span> the time when Mr. Vincy uttered that presentiment about
Rosamond, she herself had never had the idea that she should be
driven to make the sort of appeal which he foresaw. She had not yet
had any anxiety about ways and means, although her domestic life
had been expensive as well as eventful. Her baby had been born
prematurely, and all the embroidered robes and caps had to be laid
by in darkness. This misfortune was attributed entirely to her
having persisted in going out on horseback one day when her husband
had desired her not to do so; but it must not be supposed that she
had shown temper on the occasion, or rudely told him that she would
do as she liked.</p>
<p>What led her particularly to desire horse-exercise was a visit
from Captain Lydgate, the baronet’s third son, who, I am sorry to
say, was detested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop
“parting his hair from brow to nape in a despicable fashion” (not
followed by Tertius himself), and showing an ignorant security that
he knew the proper thing to say on every topic. Lydgate inwardly
cursed his own folly that he had drawn down this visit by
consenting to go to his uncle’s on the wedding-tour, and he made
himself rather disagreeable to Rosamond by saying so in private.
For to Rosamond this visit was a source of unprecedented but
gracefully concealed exultation. She was so intensely conscious of
having a cousin who was a baronet’s son staying in the house, that
she imagined the knowledge of what was implied by his presence to
be diffused through all other minds; and when she introduced
Captain Lydgate to her guests, she had a placid sense that his rank
penetrated them as if it had been an odor. The satisfaction was
enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the
conditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it
seemed now that her marriage was visibly as well as ideally
floating her above the Middlemarch level, and the future looked
bright with letters and visits to and from Quallingham, and vague
advancement in consequence for Tertius. Especially as, probably at
the Captain’s suggestion, his married sister, Mrs. Mengan, had come
with her maid, and stayed two nights on her way from town. Hence it
was clearly worth while for Rosamond to take pains with her music
and the careful selection of her lace.</p>
<p>As to Captain Lydgate himself, his low brow, his aquiline nose
bent on one side, and his rather heavy utterance, might have been
disadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a military
bearing and mustache to give him what is doted on by some
flower-like blond heads as “style.“ He had, moreover, that sort of
high-breeding which consists in being free from the petty
solicitudes of middle-class gentility, and he was a great critic of
feminine charms. Rosamond delighted in his admiration now even more
than she had done at Quallingham, and he found it easy to spend
several hours of the day in flirting with her. The visit altogether
was one of the pleasantest larks he had ever had, not the less so
perhaps because he suspected that his queer cousin Tertius wished
him away: though Lydgate, who would rather (hyperbolically
speaking) have died than have failed in polite hospitality,
suppressed his dislike, and only pretended generally not to hear
what the gallant officer said, consigning the task of answering him
to Rosamond. For he was not at all a jealous husband, and preferred
leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone with his wife to
bearing him company.</p>
<p>“I wish you would talk more to the Captain at dinner, Tertius,”
said Rosamond, one evening when the important guest was gone to
Loamford to see some brother officers stationed there. “You really
look so absent sometimes—you seem to be seeing through his head
into something behind it, instead of looking at him.”</p>
<p>“My dear Rosy, you don’t expect me to talk much to such a
conceited ass as that, I hope,” said Lydgate, brusquely. “If he got
his head broken, I might look at it with interest, not before.”</p>
<p>“I cannot conceive why you should speak of your cousin so
contemptuously,” said Rosamond, her fingers moving at her work
while she spoke with a mild gravity which had a touch of disdain in
it.</p>
<p>“Ask Ladislaw if he doesn’t think your Captain the greatest bore
he ever met with. Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he
came.”</p>
<p>Rosamond thought she knew perfectly well why Mr. Ladislaw
disliked the Captain: he was jealous, and she liked his being
jealous.</p>
<p>“It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,” she
answered, “but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough
gentleman, and I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin,
to treat him with neglect.”</p>
<p>“No, dear; but we have had dinners for him. And he comes in and
goes out as he likes. He doesn’t want me.”</p>
<p>“Still, when he is in the room, you might show him more
attention. He may not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his
profession is different; but it would be all the better for you to
talk a little on his subjects. <i>I</i> think his conversation is
quite agreeable. And he is anything but an unprincipled man."</p>
<p>“The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him,
Rosy,” said Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile
which was not exactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was
silent and did not smile again; but the lovely curves of her face
looked good-tempered enough without smiling.</p>
<p>Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how
far he had travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond
Vincy appeared to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would
reverence her husband’s mind after the fashion of an accomplished
mermaid, using her comb and looking-glass and singing her song for
the relaxation of his adored wisdom alone. He had begun to
distinguish between that imagined adoration and the attraction
towards a man’s talent because it gives him prestige, and is like
an order in his button-hole or an Honorable before his name.</p>
<p>It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too,
since she had found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale
perfectly wearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which
is unendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else,
indeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate’s
stupidity was delicately scented, carried itself with “style,“
talked with a good accent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin.
Rosamond found it quite agreeable and caught many of its
phrases.</p>
<p>Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback,
there were plenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume
her riding when Captain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two
horses to follow him and put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her
to go out on the gray which he warranted to be gentle and trained
to carry a lady—indeed, he had bought it for his sister, and was
taking it to Quallingham. Rosamond went out the first time without
telling her husband, and came back before his return; but the ride
had been so thorough a success, and she declared herself so much
the better in consequence, that he was informed of it with full
reliance on his consent that she should go riding again.</p>
<p>On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly
confounded that she had risked herself on a strange horse without
referring the matter to his wish. After the first almost thundering
exclamations of astonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of
what was coming, he was silent for some moments.</p>
<p>“However, you have come back safely,” he said, at last, in a
decisive tone. “You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If
it were the quietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would
always be the chance of accident. And you know very well that I
wished you to give up riding the roan on that account.”</p>
<p>“But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.”</p>
<p>“My darling, don’t talk nonsense,” said Lydgate, in an imploring
tone; “surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is
enough that I say you are not to go again.”</p>
<p>Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the
reflection of her head in the glass showed no change in its
loveliness except a little turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate
had been moving about with his hands in his pockets, and now paused
near her, as if he awaited some assurance.</p>
<p>“I wish you would fasten up my plaits, dear,” said Rosamond,
letting her arms fall with a little sigh, so as to make a husband
ashamed of standing there like a brute. Lydgate had often fastened
the plaits before, being among the deftest of men with his large
finely formed fingers. He swept up the soft festoons of plaits and
fastened in the tall comb (to such uses do men come!); and what
could he do then but kiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all
its delicate curves? But when we do what we have done before, it is
often with a difference. Lydgate was still angry, and had not
forgotten his point.</p>
<p>“I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better
than offer you his horse,” he said, as he moved away.</p>
<p>“I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,” said
Rosamond, looking at him with something more marked than usual in
her speech. “It will be treating me as if I were a child. Promise
that you will leave the subject to me.”</p>
<p>There did seem to be some truth in her objection. Lydgate said,
“Very well,” with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended
with his promising Rosamond, and not with her promising him.</p>
<p>In fact, she had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had
that victorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in
impetuous resistance. What she liked to do was to her the right
thing, and all her cleverness was directed to getting the means of
doing it. She meant to go out riding again on the gray, and she did
go on the next opportunity of her husband’s absence, not intending
that he should know until it was late enough not to signify to her.
The temptation was certainly great: she was very fond of the
exercise, and the gratification of riding on a fine horse, with
Captain Lydgate, Sir Godwin’s son, on another fine horse by her
side, and of being met in this position by any one but her husband,
was something as good as her dreams before marriage: moreover she
was riveting the connection with the family at Quallingham, which
must be a wise thing to do.</p>
<p>But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was
being felled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a
worse fright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby.
Lydgate could not show his anger towards her, but he was rather
bearish to the Captain, whose visit naturally soon came to an
end.</p>
<p>In all future conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly
certain that the ride had made no difference, and that if she had
stayed at home the same symptoms would have come on and would have
ended in the same way, because she had felt something like them
before.</p>
<p>Lydgate could only say, “Poor, poor darling!”—but he secretly
wondered over the terrible tenacity of this mild creature. There
was gathering within him an amazed sense of his powerlessness over
Rosamond. His superior knowledge and mental force, instead of
being, as he had imagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions,
was simply set aside on every practical question. He had regarded
Rosamond’s cleverness as precisely of the receptive kind which
became a woman. He was now beginning to find out what that
cleverness was—what was the shape into which it had run as into a
close network aloof and independent. No one quicker than Rosamond
to see causes and effects which lay within the track of her own
tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s preeminence in
Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively tracing still
more agreeable social effects when his talent should have advanced
him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had no
other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the
fortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart,
with which she had nothing to do, of course she believed in her own
opinion more than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in
numberless trifling matters, as well as in this last serious case
of the riding, that affection did not make her compliant. He had no
doubt that the affection was there, and had no presentiment that he
had done anything to repel it. For his own part he said to himself
that he loved her as tenderly as ever, and could make up his mind
to her negations; but—well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious
of new elements in his life as noxious to him as an inlet of mud to
a creature that has been used to breathe and bathe and dart after
its illuminated prey in the clearest of waters.</p>
<p>Rosamond was soon looking lovelier than ever at her worktable,
enjoying drives in her father’s phaeton and thinking it likely that
she might be invited to Quallingham. She knew that she was a much
more exquisite ornament to the drawing-room there than any daughter
of the family, and in reflecting that the gentlemen were aware of
that, did not perhaps sufficiently consider whether the ladies
would be eager to see themselves surpassed.</p>
<p>Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she
inwardly called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his
thoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well
as that uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary
things as if they were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a
sort of weather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These latter
states of mind had one cause amongst others, which he had
generously but mistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it
should affect her health and spirits. Between him and her indeed
there was that total missing of each other’s mental track, which is
too evidently possible even between persons who are continually
thinking of each other. To Lydgate it seemed that he had been
spending month after month in sacrificing more than half of his
best intent and best power to his tenderness for Rosamond; bearing
her little claims and interruptions without impatience, and, above
all, bearing without betrayal of bitterness to look through less
and less of interfering illusion at the blank unreflecting surface
her mind presented to his ardor for the more impersonal ends of his
profession and his scientific study, an ardor which he had fancied
that the ideal wife must somehow worship as sublime, though not in
the least knowing why. But his endurance was mingled with a
self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we shall
confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,
wife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had
been greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us.
Lydgate was aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often
little more than the lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping
paralysis apt to seize an enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to
a constant portion of our lives. And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there
was constantly pressing not a simple weight of sorrow, but the
biting presence of a petty degrading care, such as casts the blight
of irony over all higher effort.</p>
<p>This was the care which he had hitherto abstained from
mentioning to Rosamond; and he believed, with some wonder, that it
had never entered her mind, though certainly no difficulty could be
less mysterious. It was an inference with a conspicuous handle to
it, and had been easily drawn by indifferent observers, that
Lydgate was in debt; and he could not succeed in keeping out of his
mind for long together that he was every day getting deeper into
that swamp, which tempts men towards it with such a pretty covering
of flowers and verdure. It is wonderful how soon a man gets up to
his chin there—in a condition in which, spite of himself, he is
forced to think chiefly of release, though he had a scheme of the
universe in his soul.</p>
<p>Eighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the
eager want of small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for
any one who descended a step in order to gain them. He was now
experiencing something worse than a simple deficit: he was assailed
by the vulgar hateful trials of a man who has bought and used a
great many things which might have been done without, and which he
is unable to pay for, though the demand for payment has become
pressing.</p>
<p>How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic
or knowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and
preparing for marriage finds that his furniture and other initial
expenses come to between four and five hundred pounds more than he
has capital to pay for; when at the end of a year it appears that
his household expenses, horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a
thousand, while the proceeds of the practice reckoned from the old
books to be worth eight hundred per annum have sunk like a summer
pond and make hardly five hundred, chiefly in unpaid entries, the
plain inference is that, whether he minds it or not, he is in debt.
Those were less expensive times than our own, and provincial life
was comparatively modest; but the ease with which a medical man who
had lately bought a practice, who thought that he was obliged to
keep two horses, whose table was supplied without stint, and who
paid an insurance on his life and a high rent for house and garden,
might find his expenses doubling his receipts, can be conceived by
any one who does not think these details beneath his consideration.
Rosamond, accustomed from her to an extravagant household, thought
that good housekeeping consisted simply in ordering the best of
everything—nothing else “answered;“ and Lydgate supposed that ”if
things were done at all, they must be done properly“—he did not see
how they were to live otherwise. If each head of household
expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would have
probably observed that ”it could hardly come to much,“ and if any
one had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the
substitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him
simply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an
occasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving
invitations, and Lydgate, though he often thought the guests
tiresome, did not interfere. This sociability seemed a necessary
part of professional prudence, and the entertainment must be
suitable. It is true Lydgate was constantly visiting the homes of
the poor and adjusting his prescriptions of diet to their small
means; but, dear me! has it not by this time ceased to be
remarkable—is it not rather that we expect in men, that they should
have numerous strands of experience lying side by side and never
compare them with each other? Expenditure—like ugliness and
errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own
personality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is
manifest (in our own sensations) between ourselves and others.
Lydgate believed himself to be careless about his dress, and he
despised a man who calculated the effects of his costume; it seemed
to him only a matter of course that he had abundance of fresh
garments—such things were naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be
remembered that he had never hitherto felt the check of importunate
debt, and he walked by habit, not by self-criticism. But the check
had come.</p>
<p>Its novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed,
disgusted that conditions so foreign to all his purposes, so
hatefully disconnected with the objects he cared to occupy himself
with, should have lain in ambush and clutched him when he was
unaware. And there was not only the actual debt; there was the
certainty that in his present position he must go on deepening it.
Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose bills had been incurred
before his marriage, and whom uncalculated current expenses had
ever since prevented him from paying, had repeatedly sent him
unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on his attention.
This could hardly have been more galling to any disposition than to
Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of asking a favor or
being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned even to form
conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters, and
nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his
father-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various
indirect ways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were
not flourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be
resented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had
never in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he
should need to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be
to him; but now that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he
would rather incur any other hardship. In the mean time he had no
money or prospects of money; and his practice was not getting more
lucrative.</p>
<p>No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of
inward trouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond
was regaining brilliant health, he meditated taking her entirely
into confidence on his difficulties. New conversance with
tradesmen’s bills had forced his reasoning into a new channel of
comparison: he had begun to consider from a new point of view what
was necessary and unnecessary in goods ordered, and to see that
there must be some change of habits. How could such a change be
made without Rosamond’s concurrence? The immediate occasion of
opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.</p>
<p>Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what
security could possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate
had offered the one good security in his power to the less
peremptory creditor, who was a silversmith and jeweller, and who
consented to take on himself the upholsterer’s credit also,
accepting interest for a given term. The security necessary was a
bill of sale on the furniture of his house, which might make a
creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt amounting to less
than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr. Dover, was
willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate and any
other article which was as good as new. “Any other article” was a
phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some
purple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as
a bridal present.</p>
<p>Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present:
some may think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from
a man like Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome
consequences lay in the pinched narrowness of provincial life at
that time, which offered no conveniences for professional people
whose fortune was not proportioned to their tastes; also, in
Lydgate’s ridiculous fastidiousness about asking his friends for
money.</p>
<p>However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that
fine morning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the
presence of other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition
to orders of which the amount had not been exactly calculated,
thirty pounds for ornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s
neck and arms could hardly appear excessive when there was no ready
cash for it to exceed. But at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination
could not help dwelling on the possibility of letting the amethysts
take their place again among Mr. Dover’s stock, though he shrank
from the idea of proposing this to Rosamond. Having been roused to
discern consequences which he had never been in the habit of
tracing, he was preparing to act on this discernment with some of
the rigor (by no means all) that he would have applied in pursuing
experiment. He was nerving himself to this rigor as he rode from
Brassing, and meditated on the representations he must make to
Rosamond.</p>
<p>It was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable,
this strong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not
saying angrily within himself that he had made a profound mistake;
but the mistake was at work in him like a recognized chronic
disease, mingling its uneasy importunities with every prospect, and
enfeebling every thought. As he went along the passage to the
drawing-room, he heard the piano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw
was there. It was some weeks since Will had parted from Dorothea,
yet he was still at the old post in Middlemarch. Lydgate had no
objection in general to Ladislaw’s coming, but just now he was
annoyed that he could not find his hearth free. When he opened the
door the two singers went on towards the key-note, raising their
eyes and looking at him indeed, but not regarding his entrance as
an interruption. To a man galled with his harness as poor Lydgate
was, it is not soothing to see two people warbling at him, as he
comes in with the sense that the painful day has still pains in
store. His face, already paler than usual, took on a scowl as he
walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.</p>
<p>The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had
only three bars to sing, now turned round.</p>
<p>“How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake
hands.</p>
<p>Lydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to
speak.</p>
<p>“Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said
Rosamond, who had already seen that her husband was in a “horrible
humor.“ She seated herself in her usual place as she spoke.</p>
<p>“I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate,
curtly, still scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched
out before him.</p>
<p>Will was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said,
reaching his hat.</p>
<p>“Tea is coming,” said Rosamond; “pray don’t go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lydgate is bored,” said Will, who had more comprehension
of Lydgate than Rosamond had, and was not offended by his manner,
easily imagining outdoor causes of annoyance.</p>
<p>“There is the more need for you to stay,” said Rosamond,
playfully, and in her lightest accent; “he will not speak to me all
the evening.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Rosamond, I shall,” said Lydgate, in his strong baritone.
“I have some serious business to speak to you about.”</p>
<p>No introduction of the business could have been less like that
which Lydgate had intended; but her indifferent manner had been too
provoking.</p>
<p>“There! you see,” said Will. “I’m going to the meeting about the
Mechanics’ Institute. Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the
room.</p>
<p>Rosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and
took her place before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had
never seen him so disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her
and watched her as she delicately handled the tea-service with her
taper fingers, and looked at the objects immediately before her
with no curve in her face disturbed, and yet with an ineffable
protest in her air against all people with unpleasant manners. For
the moment he lost the sense of his wound in a sudden speculation
about this new form of feminine impassibility revealing itself in
the sylph-like frame which he had once interpreted as the sign of a
ready intelligent sensitiveness. His mind glancing back to Laure
while he looked at Rosamond, he said inwardly, “Would <i>she</i>
kill me because I wearied her?" and then, "It is the way with all
women." But this power of generalizing which gives men so much the
superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was immediately
thwarted by Lydgate's memory of wondering impressions from the
behavior of another woman—from Dorothea's looks and tones of
emotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her
passionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for
whose sake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her
except the yearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived
impressions succeeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate's
mind while the tea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the
last instant of reverie while he heard Dorothea saying, "Advise
me—think what I can do—he has been all his life laboring and
looking forward. He minds about nothing else—and I mind about
nothing else."</p>
<p>That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as
the enkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained
within him (is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also
reigns over human spirits and their conclusions?); the tones were a
music from which he was falling away—he had really fallen into a
momentary doze, when Rosamond said in her silvery neutral way,
“Here is your tea, Tertius,” setting it on the small table by his
side, and then moved back to her place without looking at him.
Lydgate was too hasty in attributing insensibility to her; after
her own fashion, she was sensitive enough, and took lasting
impressions. Her impression now was one of offence and repulsion.
But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had never raised her voice:
she was quite sure that no one could justly find fault with
her.</p>
<p>Perhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other
before; but there were strong reasons for not deferring his
revelation, even if he had not already begun it by that abrupt
announcement; indeed some of the angry desire to rouse her into
more sensibility on his account which had prompted him to speak
prematurely, still mingled with his pain in the prospect of her
pain. But he waited till the tray was gone, the candles were lit,
and the evening quiet might be counted on: the interval had left
time for repelled tenderness to return into the old course. He
spoke kindly.</p>
<p>“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said,
gently, pushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw
a chair near his own.</p>
<p>Rosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of
transparent faintly tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never
looked more graceful; as she sat down by him and laid one hand on
the elbow of his chair, at last looking at him and meeting his
eyes, her delicate neck and cheek and purely cut lips never had
more of that untarnished beauty which touches as in spring-time and
infancy and all sweet freshness. It touched Lydgate now, and
mingled the early moments of his love for her with all the other
memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep trouble. He laid
his ample hand softly on hers, saying—</p>
<p>“Dear!“ with the lingering utterance which affection gives to
the word. Rosamond too was still under the power of that same past,
and her husband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had
stirred delight. She put his hair lightly away from his forehead,
then laid her other hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving
him.</p>
<p>“I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there
are things which husband and wife must think of together. I dare
say it has occurred to you already that I am short of money.”</p>
<p>Lydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her neck and looked at a
vase on the mantel-piece.</p>
<p>“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before
we were married, and there have been expenses since which I have
been obliged to meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at
Brassing—three hundred and eighty pounds—which has been pressing on
me a good while, and in fact we are getting deeper every day, for
people don’t pay me the faster because others want the money. I
took pains to keep it from you while you were not well; but now we
must think together about it, and you must help me.”</p>
<p>“What can—I—do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him
again. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all
languages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all
states of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative
perception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the
most neutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin utterance threw into the
words “What can—I—do!” as much neutrality as they could hold. They
fell like a mortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He did not
storm in indignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And
when he spoke again it was more in the tone of a man who forces
himself to fulfil a task.</p>
<p>“It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give
security for a time, and a man must come to make an inventory of
the furniture.”</p>
<p>Rosamond colored deeply. “Have you not asked papa for money?”
she said, as soon as she could speak.</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Then I must ask him!” she said, releasing her hands from
Lydgate’s, and rising to stand at two yards’ distance from him.</p>
<p>“No, Rosy,” said Lydgate, decisively. “It is too late to do
that. The inventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere
security: it will make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I
insist upon it that your father shall not know, unless I choose to
tell him,” added Lydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.</p>
<p>This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on
evil expectation as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady
disobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was
not given to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips
began to tremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not
possible for Lydgate, under the double stress of outward material
difficulty and of his own proud resistance to humiliating
consequences, to imagine fully what this sudden trial was to a
young creature who had known nothing but indulgence, and whose
dreams had all been of new indulgence, more exactly to her taste.
But he did wish to spare her as much as he could, and her tears cut
him to the heart. He could not speak again immediately; but
Rosamond did not go on sobbing: she tried to conquer her agitation
and wiped away her tears, continuing to look before her at the
mantel-piece.</p>
<p>“Try not to grieve, darling,” said Lydgate, turning his eyes up
towards her. That she had chosen to move away from him in this
moment of her trouble made everything harder to say, but he must
absolutely go on. “We must brace ourselves to do what is necessary.
It is I who have been in fault: I ought to have seen that I could
not afford-to live in this way. But many things have told against
me in my practice, and it really just now has ebbed to a low point.
I may recover it, but in the mean time we must pull up—we must
change our way of living. We shall weather it. When I have given
this security I shall have time to look about me; and you are so
clever that if you turn your mind to managing you will school me
into carefulness. I have been a thoughtless rascal about squaring
prices—but come, dear, sit down and forgive me.”</p>
<p>Lydgate was bowing his neck under the yoke like a creature who
had talons, but who had Reason too, which often reduces us to
meekness. When he had spoken the last words in an imploring tone,
Rosamond returned to the chair by his side. His self-blame gave her
some hope that he would attend to her opinion, and she said—</p>
<p>“Why can you not put off having the inventory made? You can send
the men away to-morrow when they come.”</p>
<p>“I shall not send them away,” said Lydgate, the peremptoriness
rising again. Was it of any use to explain?</p>
<p>“If we left Middlemarch? there would of course be a sale, and
that would do as well.”</p>
<p>“But we are not going to leave Middlemarch.”</p>
<p>“I am sure, Tertius, it would be much better to do so. Why can
we not go to London? Or near Durham, where your family is
known?”</p>
<p>“We can go nowhere without money, Rosamond.”</p>
<p>“Your friends would not wish you to be without money. And surely
these odious tradesmen might be made to understand that, and to
wait, if you would make proper representations to them.”</p>
<p>“This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn
to take my judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made
necessary arrangements, and they must be carried out. As to
friends, I have no expectations whatever from them, and shall not
ask them for anything.”</p>
<p>Rosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her mind was that
if she had known how Lydgate would behave, she would never have
married him.</p>
<p>“We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said
Lydgate, trying to be gentle again. “There are some details that I
want to consider with you. Dover says he will take a good deal of
the plate back again, and any of the jewellery we like. He really
behaves very well.”</p>
<p>“Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond,
whose very lips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her
utterance. She was determined to make no further resistance or
suggestions.</p>
<p>“Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued,
drawing a paper from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s
account. See, I have marked a number of articles, which if we
returned them would reduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I
have not marked any of the jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this
point of the jewellery very bitter to himself; but he had overcome
the feeling by severe argument. He could not propose to Rosamond
that she should return any particular present of his, but he had
told himself that he was bound to put Dover’s offer before her, and
her inward prompting might make the affair easy.</p>
<p>“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly;
“you will return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on
the paper, and Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew
it back and let it fall on his knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly
went out of the room, leaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was
she not coming back? It seemed that she had no more identified
herself with him than if they had been creatures of different
species and opposing interests. He tossed his head and thrust his
hands deep into his pockets with a sort of vengeance. There was
still science—there were still good objects to work for. He must
give a tug still—all the stronger because other satisfactions were
going.</p>
<p>But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the
leather box containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket
which contained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she
had been sitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—</p>
<p>“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what
you like of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course,
expect me to stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”</p>
<p>To many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more
terrible than one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of
the distance she was placing between them.</p>
<p>“And when shall you come back again?” he said, with a bitter
edge on his accent.</p>
<p>“Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject
to mamma.” Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more
irreproachably than she was behaving; and she went to sit down at
her work-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the
result was that he said, with some of the old emotion in his
tone—</p>
<p>“Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to
myself in the first trouble that has come.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” said Rosamond; “I shall do everything it
becomes me to do.”</p>
<p>“It is not right that the thing should be left to servants, or
that I should have to speak to them about it. And I shall be
obliged to go out—I don’t know how early. I understand your
shrinking from the humiliation of these money affairs. But, my dear
Rosamond, as a question of pride, which I feel just as much as you
can, it is surely better to manage the thing ourselves, and let the
servants see as little of it as possible; and since you are my
wife, there is no hindering your share in my disgraces—if there
were disgraces.”</p>
<p>Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, “Very
well, I will stay at home.”</p>
<p>“I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But
I will write out a list of plate that we may return, and that can
be packed up and sent at once.”</p>
<p>“The servants will know <i>that</i>," said Rosamond, with the
slightest touch of sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is
the ink, I wonder?” said Lydgate, rising, and throwing the account
on the larger table where he meant to write.</p>
<p>Rosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the
table was going to turn away, when Lydgate, who was standing close
by, put his arm round her and drew her towards him, saying—</p>
<p>“Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be
for a time, I hope, that we shall have to be stingy and particular.
Kiss me.”</p>
<p>His native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and
it is a part of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact
that an inexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him.
She received his kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an
appearance of accord was recovered for the time. But Lydgate could
not help looking forward with dread to the inevitable future
discussions about expenditure and the necessity for a complete
change in their way of living.</p>
