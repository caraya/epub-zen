<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">M</span>iss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown
into relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed
that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in
which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her
profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more
dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial
fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the
Bible,—or from one of our elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day's
newspaper. She was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever,
but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense.
Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely more trimmings; and it was only
to close observers that her dress differed from her sister's, and
had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss Brooke's
plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her
sister shared. The pride of being ladies had something to do with
it: the Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were
unquestionably "good:" if you inquired backward for a generation or
two, you would not find any yard-measuring or parcel-tying
forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a clergyman; and
there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan gentleman who
served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and managed to
come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a
respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a
quiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger
than a parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a
huckster's daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in
those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted from,
when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank.
Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress,
quite apart from religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke's case,
religion alone would have determined it; and Celia mildly
acquiesced in all her sister's sentiments, only infusing them with
that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines
without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea knew many passages of
Pascal's Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to her the
destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the
solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam.
She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving
eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and artificial
protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned by its
nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly
include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there; she
was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing
whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek
martyrdom, to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after
all in a quarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such
elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to
interfere with her lot, and hinder it from being decided according
to custom, by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection. With
all this, she, the elder of the sisters, was not yet twenty, and
they had both been educated, since they were about twelve years old
and had lost their parents, on plans at once narrow and
promiscuous, first in an English family and afterwards in a Swiss
family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and guardian trying in
this way to remedy the disadvantages of their orphaned
condition.</p>
<p>It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton
Grange with their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper,
miscellaneous opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his
younger years, and was held in this part of the county to have
contracted a too rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions
were as difficult to predict as the weather: it was only safe to
say that he would act with benevolent intentions, and that he would
spend as little money as possible in carrying them out. For the
most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of
habit; and a man has been seen lax about all his own interests
except the retention of his snuff-box, concerning which he was
watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.</p>
<p>In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was
clearly in abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike
through faults and virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of
her uncle’s talk or his way of “letting things be” on his estate,
and making her long all the more for the time when she would be of
age and have some command of money for generous schemes. She was
regarded as an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred
a-year each from their parents, but if Dorothea married and had a
son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s estate, presumably worth
about three thousand a-year—a rental which seemed wealth to
provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late conduct on
the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and of that
gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities of
genteel life.</p>
<p>And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with
such prospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes,
and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which
might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or
even might lead her at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of
some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by
the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought
herself living in the time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of
fasting like a Papist, and of sitting up at night to read old
theological books! Such a wife might awaken you some fine morning
with a new scheme for the application of her income which would
interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses:
a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in such
fellowship. Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the
great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions
were not acted on. Sane people did what their neighbors did, so
that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid
them.</p>
<p>The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the
cottagers, was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and
innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her
religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with
her, the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so
much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a
sort of blazonry or clock-face for it.</p>
<p>Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her
by this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably
reconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was
on horseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of
the country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled
pleasure she looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an
indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious
qualms; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and
always looked forward to renouncing it.</p>
<p>She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring;
indeed, it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister
Celia with attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any
gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive
than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in
love with Celia: Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she
constantly considered from Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating
whether it would be good for Celia to accept him. That he should be
regarded as a suitor to herself would have seemed to her a
ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all her eagerness to know
the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas about marriage.
She felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious Hooker, if
she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he
made in matrimony; or John Milton when his blindness had come on;
or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been
glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome baronet, who said
“Exactly“ to her remarks even when she expressed uncertainty,—how
could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful marriage must
be that where your husband was a sort of father, and could teach
you even Hebrew, if you wished it.</p>
<p>These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to
be all the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing
some middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he
himself dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be
available for such a position, that he allowed himself to be
dissuaded by Dorothea’s objections, and was in this case brave
enough to defy the world—that is to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the
Rector’s wife, and the small group of gentry with whom he visited
in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So Miss Brooke presided in
her uncle’s household, and did not at all dislike her new
authority, with the homage that belonged to it.</p>
<p>Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with
another gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom
Dorothea felt some venerating expectation. This was the Reverend
Edward Casaubon, noted in the county as a man of profound learning,
understood for many years to be engaged on a great work concerning
religious history; also as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to
his piety, and having views of his own which were to be more
clearly ascertained on the publication of his book. His very name
carried an impressiveness hardly to be measured without a precise
chronology of scholarship.</p>
<p>Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school
which she had set going in the village, and was taking her usual
place in the pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the
sisters, bent on finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of
work which she delighted in), when Celia, who had been watching her
with a hesitating desire to propose something, said—</p>
<p>“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very
busy—suppose we looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them?
It is exactly six months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and
you have not looked at them yet.”</p>
<p>Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the
full presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of
Dorothea and principle; two associated facts which might show a
mysterious electricity if you touched them incautiously. To her
relief, Dorothea’s eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.</p>
<p>“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six
calendar or six lunar months?”</p>
<p>“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of
April when uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had
forgotten them till then. I believe you have never thought of them
since you locked them up in the cabinet here.”</p>
<p>“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea
spoke in a full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She
had her pencil in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a
margin.</p>
<p>Celia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are
wanting in respect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no
notice of them. And,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a
rising sob of mortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and
Madame Poincon, who was stricter in some things even than you are,
used to wear ornaments. And Christians generally—surely there are
women in heaven now who wore jewels.” Celia was conscious of some
mental strength when she really applied herself to argument.</p>
<p>“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of
astonished discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic
action which she had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore
the ornaments. “Of course, then, let us have them out. Why did you
not tell me before? But the keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands
against the sides of her head and seemed to despair of her
memory.</p>
<p>“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been
long meditated and prearranged.</p>
<p>“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the
jewel-box.”</p>
<p>The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels
spread out, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great
collection, but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable
beauty, the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of
purple amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with
five brilliants in it. Dorothea immediately took up the necklace
and fastened it round her sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as
closely as a bracelet; but the circle suited the Henrietta-Maria
style of Celia’s head and neck, and she could see that it did, in
the pier-glass opposite.</p>
<p>“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But
this cross you must wear with your dark dresses.”</p>
<p>Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must
keep the cross yourself.”</p>
<p>“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with
careless deprecation.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress,
now,” said Celia, insistingly. “You <i>might</i> wear that."</p>
<p>“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing
I would wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.</p>
<p>“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia,
uneasily.</p>
<p>“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek.
“Souls have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit
another.”</p>
<p>“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”</p>
<p>“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I
am so fond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear.
We need discuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”</p>
<p>Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of
superiority in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the
blond flesh of an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic
persecution.</p>
<p>“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister,
will never wear them?”</p>
<p>“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear
trinkets to keep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a
necklace as that, I should feel as if I had been pirouetting. The
world would go round with me, and I should not know how to
walk.”</p>
<p>Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be
a little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would
suit you better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete
unfitness of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea,
made Celia happier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes,
which disclosed a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun
passing beyond a cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.</p>
<p>“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new
current of feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how
deeply colors seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is
the reason why gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation
of St. John. They look like fragments of heaven. I think that
emerald is more beautiful than any of them.”</p>
<p>“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not
notice this at first.”</p>
<p>“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet
on her finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the
window on a level with her eyes. All the while her thought was
trying to justify her delight in the colors by merging them in her
mystic religious joy.</p>
<p>“You <i>would</i> like those, Dorothea," said Celia, rather
falteringly, beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed
some weakness, and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion
even better than purple amethysts. "You must keep that ring and
bracelet—if nothing else. But see, these agates are very pretty and
quiet."</p>
<p>“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea.
Then, letting her hand fall on the table, she said in another
tone—“Yet what miserable men find such things, and work at them,
and sell them!” She paused again, and Celia thought that her sister
was going to renounce the ornaments, as in consistency she ought to
do.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But
take all the rest away, and the casket.”</p>
<p>She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still
looking at them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed
her eye at these little fountains of pure color.</p>
<p>“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching
her with real curiosity as to what she would do.</p>
<p>Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her
imaginative adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and
then a keen discernment, which was not without a scorching quality.
If Miss Brooke ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for
lack of inward fire.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,“ she said, rather haughtily. ”I cannot tell to what
level I may sink.“</p>
<p>Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended
her sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift
of the ornaments which she put back into the box and carried away.
Dorothea too was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing,
questioning the purity of her own feeling and speech in the scene
which had ended with that little explosion.</p>
<p>Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in
the wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should
have asked that question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea
was inconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of
the jewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced
them altogether.</p>
<p>“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing
of a necklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see
that I should be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into
society, though of course she herself ought to be bound by them.
But Dorothea is not always consistent.”</p>
<p>Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard
her sister calling her.</p>
<p>“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a
great architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and
fireplaces.”</p>
<p>As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her
sister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw
that she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they
could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in
the attitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger
had always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its
private opinions?</p>
