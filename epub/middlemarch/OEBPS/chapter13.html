<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">In</span> consequence of what he had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy
determined to speak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the
Bank at half-past one, when he was usually free from other callers.
But a visitor had come in at one o'clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so
much to say to him, that there was little chance of the interview
being over in half an hour. The banker's speech was fluent, but it
was also copious, and he used up an appreciable amount of time in
brief meditative pauses. Do not imagine his sickly aspect to have
been of the yellow, black-haired sort: he had a pale blond skin,
thin gray-besprinkled brown hair, light-gray eyes, and a large
forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone an undertone, and
sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with openness; though
there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not be given to
concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can be
shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs.
Mr. Bulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening,
and an apparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those
persons who thought themselves worth hearing infer that he was
seeking the utmost improvement from their discourse. Others, who
expected to make no great figure, disliked this kind of moral
lantern turned on them. If you are not proud of your cellar, there
is no thrill of satisfaction in seeing your guest hold up his
wine-glass to the light and look judicial. Such joys are reserved
for conscious merit. Hence Mr. Bulstrode's close attention was not
agreeable to the publicans and sinners in Middlemarch; it was
attributed by some to his being a Pharisee, and by others to his
being Evangelical. Less superficial reasoners among them wished to
know who his father and grandfather were, observing that
five-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of a Bulstrode in
Middlemarch. To his present visitor, Lydgate, the scrutinizing look
was a matter of indifference: he simply formed an unfavorable
opinion of the banker's constitution, and concluded that he had an
eager inward life with little enjoyment of tangible things.</p>
<p>“I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here
occasionally, Mr. Lydgate,” the banker observed, after a brief
pause. “If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you
a valuable coadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital
management, there will be many questions which we shall need to
discuss in private. As to the new hospital, which is nearly
finished, I shall consider what you have said about the advantages
of the special destination for fevers. The decision will rest with
me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the land and timber for the
building, he is not disposed to give his personal attention to the
object.”</p>
<p>“There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial
town like this,” said Lydgate. “A fine fever hospital in addition
to the old infirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here,
when once we get our medical reforms; and what would do more for
medical education than the spread of such schools over the country?
A born provincial man who has a grain of public spirit as well as a
few ideas, should do what he can to resist the rush of everything
that is a little better than common towards London. Any valid
professional aims may often find a freer, if not a richer field, in
the provinces.”</p>
<p>One of Lydgate’s gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous,
yet capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment.
About his ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless
expectation of success, a confidence in his own powers and
integrity much fortified by contempt for petty obstacles or
seductions of which he had had no experience. But this proud
openness was made lovable by an expression of unaffected good-will.
Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for the difference
between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked him the
better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch. One
can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a
better man.</p>
<p>“I shall rejoice to furnish your zeal with fuller
opportunities,” Mr. Bulstrode answered; “I mean, by confiding to
you the superintendence of my new hospital, should a maturer
knowledge favor that issue, for I am determined that so great an
object shall not be shackled by our two physicians. Indeed, I am
encouraged to consider your advent to this town as a gracious
indication that a more manifest blessing is now to be awarded to my
efforts, which have hitherto been much with stood. With regard to
the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point—I mean your
election. And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring a
certain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional
brethren by presenting yourself as a reformer.”</p>
<p>“I will not profess bravery,” said Lydgate, smiling, “but I
acknowledge a good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not
care for my profession, if I did not believe that better methods
were to be found and enforced there as well as everywhere
else.”</p>
<p>“The standard of that profession is low in Middlemarch, my dear
sir,” said the banker. “I mean in knowledge and skill; not in
social status, for our medical men are most of them connected with
respectable townspeople here. My own imperfect health has induced
me to give some attention to those palliative resources which the
divine mercy has placed within our reach. I have consulted eminent
men in the metropolis, and I am painfully aware of the backwardness
under which medical treatment labors in our provincial
districts.”</p>
<p>“Yes;—with our present medical rules and education, one must be
satisfied now and then to meet with a fair practitioner. As to all
the higher questions which determine the starting-point of a
diagnosis—as to the philosophy of medial evidence—any glimmering of
these can only come from a scientific culture of which country
practitioners have usually no more notion than the man in the
moon.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form
which Lydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his
comprehension. Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the
topic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more
useful.</p>
<p>“I am aware,” he said, “that the peculiar bias of medical
ability is towards material means. Nevertheless, Mr. Lydgate, I
hope we shall not vary in sentiment as to a measure in which you
are not likely to be actively concerned, but in which your
sympathetic concurrence may be an aid to me. You recognize, I hope;
the existence of spiritual interests in your patients?”</p>
<p>“Certainly I do. But those words are apt to cover different
meanings to different minds.”</p>
<p>“Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as
no teaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a
new regulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The
building stands in Mr. Farebrother’s parish. You know Mr.
Farebrother?”</p>
<p>“I have seen him. He gave me his vote. I must call to thank him.
He seems a very bright pleasant little fellow. And I understand he
is a naturalist.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to
contemplate. I suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who
has greater talents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked
meditative.</p>
<p>“I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in
Middlemarch,” said Lydgate, bluntly.</p>
<p>“What I desire,” Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more
serious, “is that Mr. Farebrother’s attendance at the hospital
should be superseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke,
in fact—and that no other spiritual aid should be called in.”</p>
<p>“As a medial man I could have no opinion on such a point unless
I knew Mr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases
in which he was applied.” Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being
circumspect.</p>
<p>“Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this
measure at present. But”—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a
more chiselled emphasis—“the subject is likely to be referred to
the medical board of the infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of
you is, that in virtue of the cooperation between us which I now
look forward to, you will not, so far as you are concerned, be
influenced by my opponents in this matter.”</p>
<p>“I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,” said
Lydgate. “The path I have chosen is to work well in my own
profession.”</p>
<p>“My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me,
indeed, this question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas
with my opponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion
for gratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not
therefore drop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify
myself with that truth which an evil generation hates. I have
devoted myself to this object of hospital-improvement, but I will
boldly confess to you, Mr. Lydgate, that I should have no interest
in hospitals if I believed that nothing more was concerned therein
than the cure of mortal diseases. I have another ground of action,
and in the face of persecution I will not conceal it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode’s voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as
he said the last words.</p>
<p>“There we certainly differ,” said Lydgate. But he was not sorry
that the door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That
florid sociable personage was become more interesting to him since
he had seen Rosamond. Not that, like her, he had been weaving any
future in which their lots were united; but a man naturally
remembers a charming girl with pleasure, and is willing to dine
where he may see her again. Before he took leave, Mr. Vincy had
given that invitation which he had been “in no hurry about,” for
Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that she thought her uncle
Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great favor.</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out
a glass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.</p>
<p>“I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?”</p>
<p>“No, no; I’ve no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,”
said Mr. Vincy, unable to omit his portable theory. “However,“ he
went on, accenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance,
”what I came here to talk about was a little affair of my young
scapegrace, Fred’s.“</p>
<p>“That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite
as different views as on diet, Vincy.”</p>
<p>“I hope not this time.” (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be
good-humored.) “The fact is, it’s about a whim of old
Featherstone’s. Somebody has been cooking up a story out of spite,
and telling it to the old man, to try to set him against Fred. He’s
very fond of Fred, and is likely to do something handsome for him;
indeed he has as good as told Fred that he means to leave him his
land, and that makes other people jealous.”</p>
<p>“Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence
from me as to the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It
was entirely from worldly vanity that you destined him for the
Church: with a family of three sons and four daughters, you were
not warranted in devoting money to an expensive education which has
succeeded in nothing but in giving him extravagant idle habits. You
are now reaping the consequences.”</p>
<p>To point out other people’s errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode
rarely shrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be
patient. When a man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and
is ready, in the interests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude
on politics generally, he has naturally a sense of his importance
to the framework of things which seems to throw questions of
private conduct into the background. And this particular reproof
irritated him more than any other. It was eminently superfluous to
him to be told that he was reaping the consequences. But he felt
his neck under Bulstrode’s yoke; and though he usually enjoyed
kicking, he was anxious to refrain from that relief.</p>
<p>“As to that, Bulstrode, it’s no use going back. I’m not one of
your pattern men, and I don’t pretend to be. I couldn’t foresee
everything in the trade; there wasn’t a finer business in
Middlemarch than ours, and the lad was clever. My poor brother was
in the Church, and would have done well—had got preferment already,
but that stomach fever took him off: else he might have been a dean
by this time. I think I was justified in what I tried to do for
Fred. If you come to religion, it seems to me a man shouldn’t want
to carve out his meat to an ounce beforehand:—one must trust a
little to Providence and be generous. It’s a good British feeling
to try and raise your family a little: in my opinion, it’s a
father’s duty to give his sons a fine chance.”</p>
<p>“I don’t wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy,
when I say that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of
worldliness and inconsistent folly.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, “I
never professed to be anything but worldly; and, what’s more, I
don’t see anybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don’t
conduct business on what you call unworldly principles. The only
difference I see is that one worldliness is a little bit honester
than another.”</p>
<p>“This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,” said Mr.
Bulstrode, who, finishing his sandwich, had thrown himself back in
his chair, and shaded his eyes as if weary. “You had some more
particular business.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old
Featherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been
borrowing or trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of
course you never said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will
insist on it that Fred should bring him a denial in your
handwriting; that is, just a bit of a note saying you don’t believe
a word of such stuff, either of his having borrowed or tried to
borrow in such a fool’s way. I suppose you can have no objection to
do that.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me. I have an objection. I am by no means sure that your
son, in his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer
word—has not tried to raise money by holding out his future
prospects, or even that some one may not have been foolish enough
to supply him on so vague a presumption: there is plenty of such
lax money-lending as of other folly in the world.”</p>
<p>“But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on
the pretence of any understanding about his uncle’s land. He is not
a liar. I don’t want to make him better than he is. I have blown
him up well—nobody can say I wink at what he does. But he is not a
liar. And I should have thought—but I may be wrong—that there was
no religion to hinder a man from believing the best of a young
fellow, when you don’t know worse. It seems to me it would be a
poor sort of religion to put a spoke in his wheel by refusing to
say you don’t believe such harm of him as you’ve got no good reason
to believe.”</p>
<p>“I am not at all sure that I should be befriending your son by
smoothing his way to the future possession of Featherstone’s
property. I cannot regard wealth as a blessing to those who use it
simply as a harvest for this world. You do not like to hear these
things, Vincy, but on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you
that I have no motive for furthering such a disposition of property
as that which you refer to. I do not shrink from saying that it
will not tend to your son’s eternal welfare or to the glory of God.
Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which
has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a
foolish bequest?”</p>
<p>“If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints
and evangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships,
that’s all I can say,” Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly. “It may be
for the glory of God, but it is not for the glory of the
Middlemarch trade, that Plymdale’s house uses those blue and green
dyes it gets from the Brassing manufactory; they rot the silk,
that’s all I know about it. Perhaps if other people knew so much of
the profit went to the glory of God, they might like it better. But
I don’t mind so much about that—I could get up a pretty row, if I
chose.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode paused a little before he answered. “You pain me
very much by speaking in this way, Vincy. I do not expect you to
understand my grounds of action—it is not an easy thing even to
thread a path for principles in the intricacies of the world—still
less to make the thread clear for the careless and the scoffing.
You must remember, if you please, that I stretch my tolerance
towards you as my wife’s brother, and that it little becomes you to
complain of me as withholding material help towards the worldly
position of your family. I must remind you that it is not your own
prudence or judgment that has enabled you to keep your place in the
trade.”</p>
<p>“Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,”
said Mr. Vincy, thoroughly nettled (a result which was seldom much
retarded by previous resolutions). “And when you married Harriet, I
don’t see how you could expect that our families should not hang by
the same nail. If you’ve changed your mind, and want my family to
come down in the world, you’d better say so. I’ve never changed;
I’m a plain Churchman now, just as I used to be before doctrines
came up. I take the world as I find it, in trade and everything
else. I’m contented to be no worse than my neighbors. But if you
want us to come down in the world, say so. I shall know better what
to do then.”</p>
<p>“You talk unreasonably. Shall you come down in the world for
want of this letter about your son?”</p>
<p>“Well, whether or not, I consider it very unhandsome of you to
refuse it. Such doings may be lined with religion, but outside they
have a nasty, dog-in-the-manger look. You might as well slander
Fred: it comes pretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn’t
set a slander going. It’s this sort of thing—this tyrannical
spirit, wanting to play bishop and banker everywhere—it’s this sort
of thing makes a man’s name stink.”</p>
<p>“Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be
exceedingly painful to Harriet as well as myself,” said Mr.
Bulstrode, with a trifle more eagerness and paleness than
usual.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to quarrel. It’s for my interest—and perhaps for
yours too—that we should be friends. I bear you no grudge; I think
no worse of you than I do of other people. A man who half starves
himself, and goes the length in family prayers, and so on, that you
do, believes in his religion whatever it may be: you could turn
over your capital just as fast with cursing and swearing:—plenty of
fellows do. You like to be master, there’s no denying that; you
must be first chop in heaven, else you won’t like it much. But
you’re my sister’s husband, and we ought to stick together; and if
I know Harriet, she’ll consider it your fault if we quarrel because
you strain at a gnat in this way, and refuse to do Fred a good
turn. And I don’t mean to say I shall bear it well. I consider it
unhandsome.”</p>
<p>Mr. Vincy rose, began to button his great-coat, and looked
steadily at his brother-in-law, meaning to imply a demand for a
decisive answer.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by
admonishing Mr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very
unsatisfactory reflection of himself in the coarse unflattering
mirror which that manufacturer’s mind presented to the subtler
lights and shadows of his fellow-men; and perhaps his experience
ought to have warned him how the scene would end. But a full-fed
fountain will be generous with its waters even in the rain, when
they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of admonition is apt
to be equally irrepressible.</p>
<p>It was not in Mr. Bulstrode’s nature to comply directly in
consequence of uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his
course, he always needed to shape his motives and bring them into
accordance with his habitual standard. He said, at last—</p>
<p>“I will reflect a little, Vincy. I will mention the subject to
Harriet. I shall probably send you a letter.”</p>
<p>“Very well. As soon as you can, please. I hope it will all be
settled before I see you to-morrow.”</p>
