<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">D</span>orothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she
had asked any dangerous questions. Every morning now she sat with
Celia in the prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a
small conservatory—Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of
mixed violets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were
so dubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was
interrupted by appeals for their interpretation made to the
oracular nurse. Dorothea sat by in her widow's dress, with an
expression which rather provoked Celia, as being much too sad; for
not only was baby quite well, but really when a husband had been so
dull and troublesome while he lived, and besides that had—well,
well! Sir James, of course, had told Celia everything, with a
strong representation how important it was that Dorothea should not
know it sooner than was inevitable.</p>
<p>But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would
not long remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she
knew the purport of her husband’s will made at the time of their
marriage, and her mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her
position, was silently occupied with what she ought to do as the
owner of Lowick Manor with the patronage of the living attached to
it.</p>
<p>One morning when her uncle paid his usual visit, though with an
unusual alacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying
that it was now pretty certain Parliament would be dissolved
forthwith, Dorothea said—</p>
<p>“Uncle, it is right now that I should consider who is to have
the living at Lowick. After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I
never heard my husband say that he had any clergyman in his mind as
a successor to himself. I think I ought to have the keys now and go
to Lowick to examine all my husband’s papers. There may be
something that would throw light on his wishes.”</p>
<p>“No hurry, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, quietly. “By-and-by, you
know, you can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in
the desks and drawers—there was nothing—nothing but deep subjects,
you know—besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to
the living, I have had an application for interest already—I should
say rather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me—I had
something to do with getting him an appointment before. An
apostolic man, I believe—the sort of thing that would suit you, my
dear.”</p>
<p>“I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and
judge for myself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of
his wishes. He has perhaps made some addition to his will—there may
be some instructions for me,” said Dorothea, who had all the while
had this conjecture in her mind with relation to her husband’s
work.</p>
<p>“Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,” said Mr. Brooke,
rising to go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: “nor
about his researches, you know. Nothing in the will.”</p>
<p>Dorothea’s lip quivered.</p>
<p>“Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear.
By-and-by, you know.”</p>
<p>“I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now—I have no end
of work now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is
Celia and her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a
sort of grandfather,” said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious
to get away and tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr.
Brooke’s) fault if Dorothea insisted on looking into
everything.</p>
<p>Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the
room, and cast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.</p>
<p>“Look, Dodo! look at him! Did you ever see anything like that?”
said Celia, in her comfortable staccato.</p>
<p>“What, Kitty?” said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather
absently.</p>
<p>“What? why, his upper lip; see how he is drawing it down, as if
he meant to make a face. Isn’t it wonderful! He may have his little
thoughts. I wish nurse were here. Do look at him.”</p>
<p>A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down
Dorothea’s cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I
am sure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should
be happy now.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look
over everything—to see if there were any words written for me.”</p>
<p>“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has
not said so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and
down the gallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your
head as usual, Dodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”</p>
<p>“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was
almost ready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really
wondering with some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her
advantage, and was determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as
well as she did, or knew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was
born, she had had a new sense of her mental solidity and calm
wisdom. It seemed clear that where there was a baby, things were
right enough, and that error, in general, was a mere lack of that
central poising force.</p>
<p>“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,”
said Celia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything
uncomfortable for you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished
it. As if you had not been uncomfortable enough before. And he
doesn’t deserve it, and you will find that out. He has behaved very
badly. James is as angry with him as can be. And I had better tell
you, to prepare you.”</p>
<p>“Celia,“ said Dorothea, entreatingly, ”you distress me. Tell me
at once what you mean.“ It glanced through her mind that’ Mr.
Casaubon had left the property away from her—which would not be so
very distressing.</p>
<p>“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was
all to go away from you if you married—I mean—”</p>
<p>“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in
impetuously.</p>
<p>“But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went
on with persevering quietude. “Of course that is of no consequence
in one way—you never <i>would</i> marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only
makes it worse of Mr. Casaubon."</p>
<p>The blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully. But
Celia was administering what she thought a sobering dose of fact.
It was taking up notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm.
So she went on in her neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on
baby’s robes.</p>
<p>“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a
gentleman. And there never was a better judge than James. It is as
if Mr. Casaubon wanted to make people believe that you would wish
to marry Mr. Ladislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was
to hinder Mr. Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your
money—just as if he ever would think of making you an offer. Mrs.
Cadwallader said you might as well marry an Italian with white
mice! But I must just go and look at baby,” Celia added, without
the least change of tone, throwing a light shawl over her, and
tripping away.</p>
<p>Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw
herself back helplessly in her chair. She might have compared her
experience at that moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that
her life was taking on a new form that she was undergoing a
metamorphosis in which memory would not adjust itself to the
stirring of new organs. Everything was changing its aspect: her
husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling towards him, every
struggle between them—and yet more, her whole relation to Will
Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive change; the only
thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that she must wait
and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had been a sin;
it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed husband, who
had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she said and
did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also made
her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards
Will Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,
under any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the
sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that
light—that perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a
possibility,—and this with the hurrying, crowding vision of
unfitting conditions, and questions not soon to be solved.</p>
<p>It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she
heard Celia saying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my
lap now. You can go to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next
room.” “What I think, Dodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more
than that Dorothea was leaning back in her chair, and likely to be
passive, “is that Mr. Casaubon was spiteful. I never did like him,
and James never did. I think the corners of his mouth were
dreadfully spiteful. And now he has behaved in this way, I am sure
religion does not require you to make yourself uncomfortable about
him. If he has been taken away, that is a mercy, and you ought to
be grateful. We should not grieve, should we, baby?” said Celia
confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise of the world,
who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to the nails,
and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to make—you
didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.</p>
<p>At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first
things he said was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs.
Casaubon; have you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.”
Dorothea’s hand was of a marble coldness.</p>
<p>“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia.
“She ought not, ought she?”</p>
<p>Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking
at Dorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do
what would give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not
always come from being forbidden to act.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is
wise. There are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why
should I sit here idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects
not connected with her agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know
every one in Middlemarch, I think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to
tell me a great deal. I have serious things to do now. I have a
living to give away. You know Mr. Tyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s
effort was too much for her; she broke off and burst into sobs.
Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.</p>
<p>“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom
he asked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect
freedom, I think, more than any other prescription.”</p>
<p>His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had
enabled him to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of
her life. He felt sure that she had been suffering from the strain
and conflict of self-repression; and that she was likely now to
feel herself only in another sort of pinfold than that from which
she had been released.</p>
<p>Lydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when
he found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact
about the will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any
further delay in the execution of necessary business. And the next
day Sir James complied at once with her request that he would drive
her to Lowick.</p>
<p>“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I
could hardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I
shall be able to think better about what should be done at Lowick
by looking at it from a distance. And I should like to be at the
Grange a little while with my uncle, and go about in all the old
walks and among the people in the village.”</p>
<p>“Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and
you are better out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who
at that moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young
Ladislaw’s. But no word passed between him and Dorothea about the
objectionable part of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the
mention of it between them would be impossible. Sir James was shy,
even with men, about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that
Dorothea would have chosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter
at all, was forbidden to her at present because it seemed to be a
further exposure of her husband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that
Sir James could know what had passed between her and her husband
about Will Ladislaw’s moral claim on the property: it would then,
she thought, be apparent to him as it was to her, that her
husband’s strange indelicate proviso had been chiefly urged by his
bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and not merely by personal
feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it must be admitted,
Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will’s sake, since her
friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of Mr.
Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an Italian
carrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed
like a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish
finger.</p>
<p>At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her
husband’s places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper
addressed especially to her, except that “Synoptical Tabulation,”
which was probably only the beginning of many intended directions
for her guidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to
Dorothea, as in all else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and
hesitating, oppressed in the plan of transmitting his work, as he
had been in executing it, by the sense of moving heavily in a dim
and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea’s competence to arrange
what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust of any other
redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for himself out
of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do: and he
willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to
erect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called
the future volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all
Mythologies.) But the months gained on him and left his plans
belated: he had only had time to ask for that promise by which he
sought to keep his cold grasp on Dorothea’s life.</p>
<p>The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the
depths of her pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a
toil which her judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that
consecration of faithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her
judgment, instead of being controlled by duteous devotion, was made
active by the imbittering discovery that in her past union there
had lurked the hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The
living, suffering man was no longer before her to awaken her pity:
there remained only the retrospect of painful subjection to a
husband whose thoughts had been lower than she had believed, whose
exorbitant claims for himself had even blinded his scrupulous care
for his own character, and made him defeat his own pride by
shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the property which was the
sign of that broken tie, she would have been glad to be free from
it and have nothing more than her original fortune which had been
settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to ownership,
which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many
troublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in
thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was
it not impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr.
Casaubon had taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even
with indignation against him in her heart, any act that seemed a
triumphant eluding of his purpose revolted her.</p>
<p>After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine,
she locked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal
words for her—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely
brooding his heart had gone out to her in excuse or explanation;
and she went back to Freshitt with the sense that around his last
hard demand and his last injurious assertion of his power, the
silence was unbroken.</p>
<p>Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate
duties, and one of these was of a kind which others were determined
to remind her of. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of
the living, and as soon as he could, he reopened the subject,
seeing here a possibility of making amends for the casting-vote he
had once given with an ill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of
telling you anything about Mr. Tyke,” he said, “I should like to
speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother, the Vicar of St. Botolph’s.
His living is a poor one, and gives him a stinted provision for
himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and sister all live with
him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never married because of
them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such plain, easy
eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross after
old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects: original,
simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to have
done more than he has done.”</p>
<p>“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all
who had slipped below their own intention.</p>
<p>“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s
uncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so
many strings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has
got into the wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of
a poor clergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on.
He is very fond of Natural History and various scientific matters,
and he is hampered in reconciling these tastes with his position.
He has no money to spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him
into card-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does
play for money, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him
into company a little beneath him, and makes him slack about some
things; and yet, with all that, looking at him as a whole, I think
he is one of the most blameless men I ever knew. He has neither
venom nor doubleness in him, and those often go with a more correct
outside.”</p>
<p>“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that
habit,” said Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave
it off.”</p>
<p>“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted
into plenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”</p>
<p>“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,”
said Dorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to
restore the times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr.
Farebrother with a strong desire to rescue him from his
chance-gotten money.</p>
<p>“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said
Lydgate. “His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he
is only a parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and
make better. Practically I find that what is called being apostolic
now, is an impatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut
the principal figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the
Hospital: a good deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to
make people uncomfortably—aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man
at Lowick!—he ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is
needful to preach to the birds.”</p>
<p>“True,“ said Dorothea. ”It is hard to imagine what sort of
notions our farmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have
been looking into a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons
would be of no use at Lowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness
and the prophecies in the Apocalypse. I have always been thinking
of the different ways in which Christianity is taught, and whenever
I find one way that makes it a wider blessing than any other, I
cling to that as the truest—I mean that which takes in the most
good of all kinds, and brings in the most people as sharers in it.
It is surely better to pardon too much, than to condemn too much.
But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear him preach.“</p>
<p>“Do,“ said Lydgate; ”I trust to the effect of that. He is very
much beloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people
who can’t forgive an able man for differing from them. And that
money-winning business is really a blot. You don’t, of course, see
many Middlemarch people: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing
Mr. Brooke, is a great friend of Mr. Farebrother’s old ladies, and
would be glad to sing the Vicar’s praises. One of the old
ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a wonderfully quaint picture of
self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw gallants her about sometimes.
I met them one day in a back street: you know Ladislaw’s look—a
sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this little old maid
reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple dropped out of a
romantic comedy. But the best evidence about Farebrother is to see
him and hear him.“</p>
<p>Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this
conversation occurred, and there was no one present to make
Lydgate’s innocent introduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was
usual with him in matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite
forgotten Rosamond’s remark that she thought Will adored Mrs.
Casaubon. At that moment he was only caring for what would
recommend the Farebrother family; and he had purposely given
emphasis to the worst that could be said about the Vicar, in order
to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr. Casaubon’s death he
had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor to warn him
that Mr. Brooke’s confidential secretary was a dangerous subject
with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw
lingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of
the Lowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would
he hear of that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used
to do? And how would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as
well as possible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An
Italian with white mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who
entered into every one’s feelings, and could take the pressure of
their thought instead of urging his own with iron resistance.</p>
