        “Non, je ne comprends pas de plus charmant plaisir
         Que de voir d’heritiers une troupe affligee
         Le maintien interdit, et la mine allongee,
             Lire un long testament ou pales, etonnes
         On leur laisse un bonsoir avec un pied de nez.
         Pour voir au naturel leur tristesse profonde
         Je reviendrais, je crois, expres de l’autre monde.”

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen the animals entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that
allied species made much private remark on each other, and were
tempted to think that so many forms feeding on the same store of
fodder were eminently superfluous, as tending to diminish the
rations. (I fear the part played by the vultures on that occasion
would be too painful for art to represent, those birds being
disadvantageously naked about the gullet, and apparently without
rites and ceremonies.)</p>
<p>The same sort of temptation befell the Christian Carnivora who
formed Peter Featherstone’s funeral procession; most of them having
their minds bent on a limited store which each would have liked to
get the most of. The long-recognized blood-relations and
connections by marriage made already a goodly number, which,
multiplied by possibilities, presented a fine range for jealous
conjecture and pathetic hopefulness. Jealousy of the Vincys had
created a fellowship in hostility among all persons of the
Featherstone blood, so that in the absence of any decided
indication that one of themselves was to have more than the rest,
the dread lest that long-legged Fred Vincy should have the land was
necessarily dominant, though it left abundant feeling and leisure
for vaguer jealousies, such as were entertained towards Mary Garth.
Solomon found time to reflect that Jonah was undeserving, and Jonah
to abuse Solomon as greedy; Jane, the elder sister, held that
Martha’s children ought not to expect so much as the young Waules;
and Martha, more lax on the subject of primogeniture, was sorry to
think that Jane was so “having.“ These nearest of kin were
naturally impressed with the unreasonableness of expectations in
cousins and second cousins, and used their arithmetic in reckoning
the large sums that small legacies might mount to, if there were
too many of them. Two cousins were present to hear the will, and a
second cousin besides Mr. Trumbull. This second cousin was a
Middlemarch mercer of polite manners and superfluous aspirates. The
two cousins were elderly men from Brassing, one of them conscious
of claims on the score of inconvenient expense sustained by him in
presents of oysters and other eatables to his rich cousin Peter;
the other entirely saturnine, leaning his hands and chin on a
stick, and conscious of claims based on no narrow performance but
on merit generally: both blameless citizens of Brassing, who wished
that Jonah Featherstone did not live there. The wit of a family is
usually best received among strangers.</p>
<p>“Why, Trumbull himself is pretty sure of five
hundred—<i>that</i> you may depend,—I shouldn't wonder if my
brother promised him," said Solomon, musing aloud with his sisters,
the evening before the funeral.</p>
<p>“Dear, dear!” said poor sister Martha, whose imagination of
hundreds had been habitually narrowed to the amount of her unpaid
rent.</p>
<p>But in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were
disturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed
among them as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by
Mrs. Cadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three
and thirty, whose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved
mouth, and hair sleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank
suddenly above the ridge of the eyebrows, certainly gave his face a
batrachian unchangeableness of expression. Here, clearly, was a new
legatee; else why was he bidden as a mourner? Here were new
possibilities, raising a new uncertainty, which almost checked
remark in the mourning-coaches. We are all humiliated by the sudden
discovery of a fact which has existed very comfortably and perhaps
been staring at us in private while we have been making up our
world entirely without it. No one had seen this questionable
stranger before except Mary Garth, and she knew nothing more of him
than that he had twice been to Stone Court when Mr. Featherstone
was down-stairs, and had sat alone with him for several hours. She
had found an opportunity of mentioning this to her father, and
perhaps Caleb’s were the only eyes, except the lawyer’s, which
examined the stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or
suspicion. Caleb Garth, having little expectation and less
cupidity, was interested in the verification of his own guesses,
and the calmness with which he half smilingly rubbed his chin and
shot intelligent glances much as if he were valuing a tree, made a
fine contrast with the alarm or scorn visible in other faces when
the unknown mourner, whose name was understood to be Rigg, entered
the wainscoted parlor and took his seat near the door to make part
of the audience when the will should be read. Just then Mr. Solomon
and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs with the lawyer to search for the
will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two vacant seats between herself and
Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit to move next to that great
authority, who was handling his watch-seals and trimming his
outlines with a determination not to show anything so compromising
to a man of ability as wonder or surprise.</p>
<p>“I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother’s
done, Mr. Trumbull,” said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly
tones, while she turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr.
Trumbull’s ear.</p>
<p>“My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,”
said the auctioneer, putting his hand up to screen that secret.</p>
<p>“Them who’ve made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed
yet,” Mrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this
communication.</p>
<p>“Hopes are often delusive,” said Mr. Trumbull, still in
confidence.</p>
<p>“Ah!“ said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then
moving back to the side of her sister Martha.</p>
<p>“It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same
undertones. “We none of us know what he might have had on his mind.
I only hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of,
Martha.”</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had
the additional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and
giving them a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and
liable to sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.</p>
<p>“I never <i>was</i> covetous, Jane," she replied; "but I have
six children and have buried three, and I didn't marry into money.
The eldest, that sits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to
guess. And stock always short, and land most awkward. But if ever
I've begged and prayed; it's been to God above; though where
there's one brother a bachelor and the other childless after twice
marrying—anybody might think!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr.
Rigg, and had taken out his snuff-box and tapped it, but had put it
again unopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the
judgment, was unsuited to the occasion. “I shouldn’t wonder if
Featherstone had better feelings than any of us gave him credit
for,” he observed, in the ear of his wife. “This funeral shows a
thought about everybody: it looks well when a man wants to be
followed by his friends, and if they are humble, not to be ashamed
of them. I should be all the better pleased if he’d left lots of
small legacies. They may be uncommonly useful to fellows in a small
way.”</p>
<p>“Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and
everything,” said Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.</p>
<p>But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in
repressing a laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his
father’s snuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting
something about a “love-child,“ and with this thought in his mind,
the stranger’s face, which happened to be opposite him, affected
him too ludicrously. Mary Garth, discerning his distress in the
twitchings of his mouth, and his recourse to a cough, came cleverly
to his rescue by asking him to change seats with her, so that he
got into a shadowy corner. Fred was feeling as good-naturedly as
possible towards everybody, including Rigg; and having some
relenting towards all these people who were less lucky than he was
aware of being himself, he would not for the world have behaved
amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.</p>
<p>But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every
one’s attention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he had come to
Stone Court this morning believing that he knew thoroughly well who
would be pleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The
will he expected to read was the last of three which he had drawn
up for Mr. Featherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his
manners: he behaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to
everybody, as if he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly
of the hay-crop, which would be “very fine, by God!” of the last
bulletins concerning the King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was
a sailor every inch of him, and just the man to rule over an island
like Britain.</p>
<p>Old Featherstone had often reflected as he sat looking at the
fire that Standish would be surprised some day: it is true that if
he had done as he liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by
another lawyer, he would not have secured that minor end; still he
had had his pleasure in ruminating on it. And certainly Mr.
Standish was surprised, but not at all sorry; on the contrary, he
rather enjoyed the zest of a little curiosity in his own mind,
which the discovery of a second will added to the prospective
amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.</p>
<p>As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in
utter suspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a
certain validity, and that there might be such an interlacement of
poor Peter’s former and latter intentions as to create endless
“lawing“ before anybody came by their own—an inconvenience which
would have at least the advantage of going all round. Hence the
brothers showed a thoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered
with Mr. Standish; but Solomon took out his white handkerchief
again with a sense that in any case there would be affecting
passages, and crying at funerals, however dry, was customarily
served up in lawn.</p>
<p>Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at
this moment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she
who had virtually determined the production of this second will,
which might have momentous effects on the lot of some persons
present. No soul except herself knew what had passed on that final
night.</p>
<p>“The will I hold in my hand,” said Mr. Standish, who, seated at
the table in the middle of the room, took his time about
everything, including the coughs with which he showed a disposition
to clear his voice, “was drawn up by myself and executed by our
deceased friend on the 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there
is a subsequent instrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the
20th of July, 1826, hardly a year later than the previous one. And
there is farther, I see”—Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling
over the document with his spectacles—“a codicil to this latter
will, bearing date March 1, 1828.”</p>
<p>“Dear, dear!” said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but
driven to some articulation under this pressure of dates.</p>
<p>“I shall begin by reading the earlier will,” continued Mr.
Standish, “since such, as appears by his not having destroyed the
document, was the intention of deceased.”</p>
<p>The preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides
Solomon shook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all
eyes avoided meeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on
the spots in the table-cloth or on Mr. Standish’s bald head;
excepting Mary Garth’s. When all the rest were trying to look
nowhere in particular, it was safe for her to look at them. And at
the sound of the first “give and bequeath” she could see all
complexions changing subtly, as if some faint vibration were
passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He sat in unaltered
calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more important
problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests which
might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred
blushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his
snuff-box in his hand, though he kept it closed.</p>
<p>The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that
there was another will and that poor Peter might have thought
better of it, could not quell the rising disgust and indignation.
One likes to be done well by in every tense, past, present, and
future. And here was Peter capable five years ago of leaving only
two hundred apiece to his own brothers and sisters, and only a
hundred apiece to his own nephews and nieces: the Garths were not
mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were each to have a hundred.
Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane and fifty pounds; the
other second cousins and the cousins present were each to have the
like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin observed, was a
sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was much more of
such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not
present—problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.
Altogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand
disposed of. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to
go—and where the land? and what was revoked and what not
revoked—and was the revocation for better or for worse? All emotion
must be conditional, and might turn out to be the wrong thing. The
men were strong enough to bear up and keep quiet under this
confused suspense; some letting their lower lip fall, others
pursing it up, according to the habit of their muscles. But Jane
and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and began to cry; poor
Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of getting any
hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware that her
share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely flooded
with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while
somebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was
that the “much“ would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves
were surprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments
were declared to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too?
Fred bit his lips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy
felt herself the happiest of women—possible revocation shrinking
out of sight in this dazzling vision.</p>
<p>There was still a residue of personal property as well as the
land, but the whole was left to one person, and that person was—O
possibilities! O expectations founded on the favor of “close“ old
gentlemen! O endless vocatives that would still leave expression
slipping helpless from the measurement of mortal folly!—that
residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg, who was also sole executor, and
who was to take thenceforth the name of Featherstone.</p>
<p>There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round
the room. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently
experienced no surprise.</p>
<p>“A most singular testamentary disposition!” exclaimed Mr.
Trumbull, preferring for once that he should be considered ignorant
in the past. “But there is a second will—there is a further
document. We have not yet heard the final wishes of the
deceased.”</p>
<p>Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not
the final wishes. The second will revoked everything except the
legacies to the low persons before mentioned (some alterations in
these being the occasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all
the land lying in Lowick parish with all the stock and household
furniture, to Joshua Rigg. The residue of the property was to be
devoted to the erection and endowment of almshouses for old men, to
be called Featherstone’s Alms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of
land near Middlemarch already bought for the purpose by the
testator, he wishing—so the document declared—to please God
Almighty. Nobody present had a farthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the
gold-headed cane. It took some time for the company to recover the
power of expression. Mary dared not look at Fred.</p>
<p>Mr. Vincy was the first to speak—after using his snuff-box
energetically—and he spoke with loud indignation. “The most
unaccountable will I ever heard! I should say he was not in his
right mind when he made it. I should say this last will was void,”
added Mr. Vincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the
true light. “Eh Standish?”</p>
<p>“Our deceased friend always knew what he was about, I think,”
said Mr. Standish. “Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter
from Clemmens of Brassing tied with the will. He drew it up. A very
respectable solicitor.”</p>
<p>“I never noticed any alienation of mind—any aberration of
intellect in the late Mr. Featherstone,” said Borthrop Trumbull,
“but I call this will eccentric. I was always willingly of service
to the old soul; and he intimated pretty plainly a sense of
obligation which would show itself in his will. The gold-headed
cane is farcical considered as an acknowledgment to me; but happily
I am above mercenary considerations.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,”
said Caleb Garth. “Anybody might have had more reason for wondering
if the will had been what you might expect from an open-minded
straightforward man. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as
a will.”</p>
<p>“That’s a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by
God!” said the lawyer. “I should like to know how you will back
that up, Garth!”</p>
<p>“Oh,“ said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his finger-tips
with nicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always
seemed to him that words were the hardest part of ”business.”</p>
<p>But here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. “Well, he
always was a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will
cuts out everything. If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t
have drawn me from Brassing. I’ll put a white hat and drab coat on
to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“Dear, dear,” wept Mrs. Cranch, “and we’ve been at the expense
of travelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It’s
the first time I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to
please God Almighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say
it’s hard—I can think no other.”</p>
<p>“It’ll do him no good where he’s gone, that’s my belief,” said
Solomon, with a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though his
tone could not help being sly. “Peter was a bad liver, and
almshouses won’t cover it, when he’s had the impudence to show it
at the last.”</p>
<p>“And all the while had got his own lawful family—brothers and
sisters and nephews and nieces—and has sat in church with ’em
whenever he thought well to come,” said Mrs. Waule. “And might have
left his property so respectable, to them that’s never been used to
extravagance or unsteadiness in no manner of way—and not so poor
but what they could have saved every penny and made more of it. And
me—the trouble I’ve been at, times and times, to come here and be
sisterly—and him with things on his mind all the while that might
make anybody’s flesh creep. But if the Almighty’s allowed it, he
means to punish him for it. Brother Solomon, I shall be going, if
you’ll drive me.”</p>
<p>“I’ve no desire to put my foot on the premises again,” said
Solomon. “I’ve got land of my own and property of my own to will
away.”</p>
<p>“It’s a poor tale how luck goes in the world,” said Jonah. “It
never answers to have a bit of spirit in you. You’d better be a dog
in the manger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One
fool’s will is enough in a family.”</p>
<p>“There’s more ways than one of being a fool,” said Solomon. “I
shan’t leave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan’t
leave it to foundlings from Africay. I like Feather, stones that
were brewed such, and not turned Featherstones with sticking the
name on ’em.”</p>
<p>Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as
he rose to accompany her. Brother Jonah felt himself capable of
much more stinging wit than this, but he reflected that there was
no use in offending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you
were certain that he was quite without intentions of hospitality
towards witty men whose name he was about to bear.</p>
<p>Mr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble himself little
about any innuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner,
walking coolly up to Mr. Standish and putting business questions
with much coolness. He had a high chirping voice and a vile accent.
Fred, whom he no longer moved to laughter, thought him the lowest
monster he had ever seen. But Fred was feeling rather sick. The
Middlemarch mercer waited for an opportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg
in conversation: there was no knowing how many pairs of legs the
new proprietor might require hose for, and profits were more to be
relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as a second cousin, was
dispassionate enough to feel curiosity.</p>
<p>Mr. Vincy, after his one outburst, had remained proudly silent,
though too much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of
moving, till he observed that his wife had gone to Fred’s side and
was crying silently while she held her darling’s hand. He rose
immediately, and turning his back on the company while he said to
her in an undertone,—“Don’t give way, Lucy; don’t make a fool of
yourself, my dear, before these people,” he added in his usual loud
voice—“Go and order the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to
waste.”</p>
<p>Mary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with
her father. She met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time
had the courage to look at him. He had that withered sort of
paleness which will sometimes come on young faces, and his hand was
very cold when she shook it. Mary too was agitated; she was
conscious that fatally, without will of her own, she had perhaps
made a great difference to Fred’s lot.</p>
<p>“Good-by,“ she said, with affectionate sadness. ”Be brave, Fred.
I do believe you are better without the money. What was the good of
it to Mr. Featherstone?“</p>
<p>“That’s all very fine,” said Fred, pettishly. “What is a fellow
to do? I must go into the Church now.” (He knew that this would vex
Mary: very well; then she must tell him what else he could do.)
“And I thought I should be able to pay your father at once and make
everything right. And you have not even a hundred pounds left you.
What shall you do now, Mary?”</p>
<p>“Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. My
father has enough to do to keep the rest, without me. Good-by.”</p>
<p>In a very short time Stone Court was cleared of well-brewed
Featherstones and other long-accustomed visitors. Another stranger
had been brought to settle in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, but
in the case of Mr. Rigg Featherstone there was more discontent with
immediate visible consequences than speculation as to the effect
which his presence might have in the future. No soul was prophetic
enough to have any foreboding as to what might appear on the trial
of Joshua Rigg.</p>
<p>And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating
a low subject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in
this way. The chief objection to them is, that the diligent
narrator may lack space, or (what is often the same thing) may not
be able to think of them with any degree of particularity, though
he may have a philosophical confidence that if known they would be
illustrative. It seems an easier and shorter way to dignity, to
observe that—since there never was a true story which could not be
told in parables, where you might put a monkey for a margrave, and
vice versa—whatever has been or is to be narrated by me about low
people, may be ennobled by being considered a parable; so that if
any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought into view, the
reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more than
figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company
with persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about
loobies, my reader’s imagination need not be entirely excluded from
an occupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of
high standing would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the
level of high commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition
of proportional ciphers.</p>
<p>As to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high
moral rank, that must be of a date long posterior to the first
Reform Bill, and Peter Featherstone, you perceive, was dead and
buried some months before Lord Grey came into office.</p>
