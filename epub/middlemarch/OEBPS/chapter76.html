<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">S</span>ome days later, Lydgate was riding to Lowick Manor, in
consequence of a summons from Dorothea. The summons had not been
unexpected, since it had followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode, in
which he stated that he had resumed his arrangements for quitting
Middlemarch, and must remind Lydgate of his previous communications
about the Hospital, to the purport of which he still adhered. It
had been his duty, before taking further steps, to reopen the
subject with Mrs. Casaubon, who now wished, as before, to discuss
the question with Lydgate. "Your views may possibly have undergone
some change," wrote Mr. Bulstrode; "but, in that case also, it is
desirable that you should lay them before her."</p>
<p>Dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest. Though, in
deference to her masculine advisers, she had refrained from what
Sir James had called “interfering in this Bulstrode business,” the
hardship of Lydgate’s position was continually in her mind, and
when Bulstrode applied to her again about the hospital, she felt
that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered
from hastening. In her luxurious home, wandering under the boughs
of her own great trees, her thought was going out over the lot of
others, and her emotions were imprisoned. The idea of some active
good within her reach, “haunted her like a passion,” and another’s
need having once come to her as a distinct image, preoccupied her
desire with the yearning to give relief, and made her own ease
tasteless. She was full of confident hope about this interview with
Lydgate, never heeding what was said of his personal reserve; never
heeding that she was a very young woman. Nothing could have seemed
more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence on her youth and sex
when she was moved to show her human fellowship.</p>
<p>As she sat waiting in the library, she could do nothing but live
through again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into
her memories. They all owed their significance to her marriage and
its troubles—but no; there were two occasions in which the image of
Lydgate had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one
else. The pain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in
her an awakened conjecture as to what Lydgate’s marriage might be
to him, a susceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate.
These thoughts were like a drama to her, and made her eyes bright,
and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame, though she was
only looking out from the brown library on to the turf and the
bright green buds which stood in relief against the dark
evergreens.</p>
<p>When Lydgate came in, she was almost shocked at the change in
his face, which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen
him for two months. It was not the change of emaciation, but that
effect which even young faces will very soon show from the
persistent presence of resentment and despondency. Her cordial
look, when she put out her hand to him, softened his expression,
but only with melancholy.</p>
<p>“I have wished very much to see you for a long while, Mr.
Lydgate,” said Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other;
“but I put off asking you to come until Mr. Bulstrode applied to me
again about the Hospital. I know that the advantage of keeping the
management of it separate from that of the Infirmary depends on
you, or, at least, on the good which you are encouraged to hope for
from having it under your control. And I am sure you will not
refuse to tell me exactly what you think.”</p>
<p>“You want to decide whether you should give a generous support
to the Hospital,” said Lydgate. “I cannot conscientiously advise
you to do it in dependence on any activity of mine. I may be
obliged to leave the town.”</p>
<p>He spoke curtly, feeling the ache of despair as to his being
able to carry out any purpose that Rosamond had set her mind
against.</p>
<p>“Not because there is no one to believe in you?” said Dorothea,
pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart. “I know the
unhappy mistakes about you. I knew them from the first moment to be
mistakes. You have never done anything vile. You would not do
anything dishonorable.”</p>
<p>It was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on
Lydgate’s ears. He drew a deep breath, and said, “Thank you.” He
could say no more: it was something very new and strange in his
life that these few words of trust from a woman should be so much
to him.</p>
<p>“I beseech you to tell me how everything was,” said Dorothea,
fearlessly. “I am sure that the truth would clear you.”</p>
<p>Lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window,
forgetting where he was. He had so often gone over in his mind the
possibility of explaining everything without aggravating
appearances that would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode,
and had so often decided against it—he had so often said to himself
that his assertions would not change people’s impressions—that
Dorothea’s words sounded like a temptation to do something which in
his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>“Tell me, pray,” said Dorothea, with simple earnestness; “then
we can consult together. It is wicked to let people think evil of
any one falsely, when it can be hindered.”</p>
<p>Lydgate turned, remembering where he was, and saw Dorothea’s
face looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity. The presence
of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity,
changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their
larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and
judged in the wholeness of our character. That influence was
beginning to act on Lydgate, who had for many days been seeing all
life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng. He sat
down again, and felt that he was recovering his old self in the
consciousness that he was with one who believed in it.</p>
<p>“I don’t want,” he said, “to bear hard on Bulstrode, who has
lent me money of which I was in need—though I would rather have
gone without it now. He is hunted down and miserable, and has only
a poor thread of life in him. But I should like to tell you
everything. It will be a comfort to me to speak where belief has
gone beforehand, and where I shall not seem to be offering
assertions of my own honesty. You will feel what is fair to
another, as you feel what is fair to me.”</p>
<p>“Do trust me,” said Dorothea; “I will not repeat anything
without your leave. But at the very least, I could say that you
have made all the circumstances clear to me, and that I know you
are not in any way guilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my
uncle, and Sir James Chettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch
to whom I could go; although they don’t know much of me, they would
believe me. They would know that I could have no other motive than
truth and justice. I would take any pains to clear you. I have very
little to do. There is nothing better that I can do in the
world.”</p>
<p>Dorothea’s voice, as she made this childlike picture of what she
would do, might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do
it effectively. The searching tenderness of her woman’s tones
seemed made for a defence against ready accusers. Lydgate did not
stay to think that she was Quixotic: he gave himself up, for the
first time in his life, to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely
on a generous sympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he
told her everything, from the time when, under the pressure of his
difficulties, he unwillingly made his first application to
Bulstrode; gradually, in the relief of speaking, getting into a
more thorough utterance of what had gone on in his mind—entering
fully into the fact that his treatment of the patient was opposed
to the dominant practice, into his doubts at the last, his ideal of
medical duty, and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of
the money had made some difference in his private inclination and
professional behavior, though not in his fulfilment of any publicly
recognized obligation.</p>
<p>“It has come to my knowledge since,” he added, “that Hawley sent
some one to examine the housekeeper at Stone Court, and she said
that she gave the patient all the opium in the phial I left, as
well as a good deal of brandy. But that would not have been opposed
to ordinary prescriptions, even of first-rate men. The suspicions
against me had no hold there: they are grounded on the knowledge
that I took money, that Bulstrode had strong motives for wishing
the man to die, and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur
in some malpractices or other against the patient—that in any case
I accepted a bribe to hold my tongue. They are just the suspicions
that cling the most obstinately, because they lie in people’s
inclination and can never be disproved. How my orders came to be
disobeyed is a question to which I don’t know the answer. It is
still possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any criminal
intention—even possible that he had nothing to do with the
disobedience, and merely abstained from mentioning it. But all that
has nothing to do with the public belief. It is one of those cases
on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is
believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way,
because he had the motive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character
has enveloped me, because I took his money. I am simply
blighted—like a damaged ear of corn—the business is done and can’t
be undone.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. “I understand the difficulty
there is in your vindicating yourself. And that all this should
have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the
common, and to find out better ways—I cannot bear to rest in this
as unchangeable. I know you meant that. I remember what you said to
me when you first spoke to me about the hospital. There is no
sorrow I have thought more about than that—to love what is great,
and try to reach it, and yet to fail.”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the
full meaning of his grief. ”I had some ambition. I meant everything
to be different with me. I thought I had more strength and mastery.
But the most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except
oneself.“</p>
<p>“Suppose,“ said Dorothea, meditatively,—”suppose we kept on the
Hospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though
only with the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling
towards you would gradually die out; there would come opportunities
in which people would be forced to acknowledge that they had been
unjust to you, because they would see that your purposes were pure.
You may still win a great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have
heard you speak of, and we shall all be proud of you,“ she ended,
with a smile.</p>
<p>“That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate,
mournfully. “Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round
and running away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind
me. Still, I can’t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a
plan which depends on me.”</p>
<p>“It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. “Only
think. I am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me
I have too little for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and
yet I have too much. I don’t know what to do. I have seven hundred
a-year of my own fortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr.
Casaubon left me, and between three and four thousand of ready
money in the bank. I wished to raise money and pay it off gradually
out of my income which I don’t want, to buy land with and found a
village which should be a school of industry; but Sir James and my
uncle have convinced me that the risk would be too great. So you
see that what I should most rejoice at would be to have something
good to do with my money: I should like it to make other people’s
lives better to them. It makes me very uneasy—coming all to me who
don’t want it.”</p>
<p>A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. The childlike
grave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was
irresistible—blent into an adorable whole with her ready
understanding of high experience. (Of lower experience such as
plays a great part in the world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very
blurred shortsighted knowledge, little helped by her imagination.)
But she took the smile as encouragement of her plan.</p>
<p>“I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said,
in a tone of persuasion. “The hospital would be one good; and
making your life quite whole and well again would be another.”</p>
<p>Lydgate’s smile had died away. “You have the goodness as well as
the money to do all that; if it could be done,” he said. “But—“</p>
<p>He hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window;
and she sat in silent expectation. At last he turned towards her
and said impetuously—</p>
<p>“Why should I not tell you?—you know what sort of bond marriage
is. You will understand everything.”</p>
<p>Dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster. Had he that
sorrow too? But she feared to say any word, and he went on
immediately.</p>
<p>“It is impossible for me now to do anything—to take any step
without considering my wife’s happiness. The thing that I might
like to do if I were alone, is become impossible to me. I can’t see
her miserable. She married me without knowing what she was going
into, and it might have been better for her if she had not married
me.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know—you could not give her pain, if you were not
obliged to do it,” said Dorothea, with keen memory of her own
life.</p>
<p>“And she has set her mind against staying. She wishes to go. The
troubles she has had here have wearied her,” said Lydgate, breaking
off again, lest he should say too much.</p>
<p>“But when she saw the good that might come of staying—” said
Dorothea, remonstrantly, looking at Lydgate as if he had forgotten
the reasons which had just been considered. He did not speak
immediately.</p>
<p>“She would not see it,” he said at last, curtly, feeling at
first that this statement must do without explanation. “And,
indeed, I have lost all spirit about carrying on my life here.” He
paused a moment and then, following the impulse to let Dorothea see
deeper into the difficulty of his life, he said, “The fact is, this
trouble has come upon her confusedly. We have not been able to
speak to each other about it. I am not sure what is in her mind
about it: she may fear that I have really done something base. It
is my fault; I ought to be more open. But I have been suffering
cruelly.”</p>
<p>“May I go and see her?” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Would she
accept my sympathy? I would tell her that you have not been
blamable before any one’s judgment but your own. I would tell her
that you shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her
heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her
once.”</p>
<p>“I am sure you may,” said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with
some hope. “She would feel honored—cheered, I think, by the proof
that you at least have some respect for me. I will not speak to her
about your coming—that she may not connect it with my wishes at
all. I know very well that I ought not to have left anything to be
told her by others, but—”</p>
<p>He broke off, and there was a moment’s silence. Dorothea
refrained from saying what was in her mind—how well she knew that
there might be invisible barriers to speech between husband and
wife. This was a point on which even sympathy might make a wound.
She returned to the more outward aspect of Lydgate’s position,
saying cheerfully—</p>
<p>“And if Mrs. Lydgate knew that there were friends who would
believe in you and support you, she might then be glad that you
should stay in your place and recover your hopes—and do what you
meant to do. Perhaps then you would see that it was right to agree
with what I proposed about your continuing at the Hospital. Surely
you would, if you still have faith in it as a means of making your
knowledge useful?”</p>
<p>Lydgate did not answer, and she saw that he was debating with
himself.</p>
<p>“You need not decide immediately,” she said, gently. “A few days
hence it will be early enough for me to send my answer to Mr.
Bulstrode.”</p>
<p>Lydgate still waited, but at last turned to speak in his most
decisive tones.</p>
<p>“No; I prefer that there should be no interval left for
wavering. I am no longer sure enough of myself—I mean of what it
would be possible for me to do under the changed circumstances of
my life. It would be dishonorable to let others engage themselves
to anything serious in dependence on me. I might be obliged to go
away after all; I see little chance of anything else. The whole
thing is too problematic; I cannot consent to be the cause of your
goodness being wasted. No—let the new Hospital be joined with the
old Infirmary, and everything go on as it might have done if I had
never come. I have kept a valuable register since I have been
there; I shall send it to a man who will make use of it,” he ended
bitterly. “I can think of nothing for a long while but getting an
income.”</p>
<p>“It hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly,” said
Dorothea. “It would be a happiness to your friends, who believe in
your future, in your power to do great things, if you would let
them save you from that. Think how much money I have; it would be
like taking a burthen from me if you took some of it every year
till you got free from this fettering want of income. Why should
not people do these things? It is so difficult to make shares at
all even. This is one way.”</p>
<p>“God bless you, Mrs. Casaubon!” said Lydgate, rising as if with
the same impulse that made his words energetic, and resting his arm
on the back of the great leather chair he had been sitting in. “It
is good that you should have such feelings. But I am not the man
who ought to allow himself to benefit by them. I have not given
guarantees enough. I must not at least sink into the degradation of
being pensioned for work that I never achieved. It is very clear to
me that I must not count on anything else than getting away from
Middlemarch as soon as I can manage it. I should not be able for a
long while, at the very best, to get an income here, and—and it is
easier to make necessary changes in a new place. I must do as other
men do, and think what will please the world and bring in money;
look for a little opening in the London crowd, and push myself; set
up in a watering-place, or go to some southern town where there are
plenty of idle English, and get myself puffed,—that is the sort of
shell I must creep into and try to keep my soul alive in.”</p>
<p>“Now that is not brave,” said Dorothea,—“to give up the
fight.”</p>
<p>“No, it is not brave,” said Lydgate, “but if a man is afraid of
creeping paralysis?” Then, in another tone, “Yet you have made a
great difference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems
more bearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me
in a few other minds, especially in Farebrother’s, I shall be
deeply grateful. The point I wish you not to mention is the fact of
disobedience to my orders. That would soon get distorted. After
all, there is no evidence for me but people’s opinion of me
beforehand. You can only repeat my own report of myself.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Farebrother will believe—others will believe,” said
Dorothea. “I can say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose
that you would be bribed to do a wickedness.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his
voice. “I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of
bribery which is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me
another great kindness, then, and come to see my wife?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she is,” said Dorothea, into
whose mind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. “I hope
she will like me.”</p>
<p>As Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a
heart large enough for the Virgin Mary. She evidently thinks
nothing of her own future, and would pledge away half her income at
once, as if she wanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in
from which she can look down with those clear eyes at the poor
mortals who pray to her. She seems to have what I never saw in any
woman before—a fountain of friendship towards men—a man can make a
friend of her. Casaubon must have raised some heroic hallucination
in her. I wonder if she could have any other sort of passion for a
man? Ladislaw?—there was certainly an unusual feeling between them.
And Casaubon must have had a notion of it. Well—her love might help
a man more than her money.”</p>
<p>Dorothea on her side had immediately formed a plan of relieving
Lydgate from his obligation to Bulstrode, which she felt sure was a
part, though small, of the galling pressure he had to bear. She sat
down at once under the inspiration of their interview, and wrote a
brief note, in which she pleaded that she had more claim than Mr.
Bulstrode had to the satisfaction of providing the money which had
been serviceable to Lydgate—that it would be unkind in Lydgate not
to grant her the position of being his helper in this small matter,
the favor being entirely to her who had so little that was plainly
marked out for her to do with her superfluous money. He might call
her a creditor or by any other name if it did but imply that he
granted her request. She enclosed a check for a thousand pounds,
and determined to take the letter with her the next day when she
went to see Rosamond.</p>
