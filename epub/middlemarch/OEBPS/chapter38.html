<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">S</span>ir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr.
Brooke's new courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder.
Sir James accounted for his having come in alone one day to lunch
with the Cadwalladers by saying—</p>
<p>“I can’t talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her.
Indeed, it would not be right.”</p>
<p>“I know what you mean—the ’Pioneer’ at the Grange!” darted in
Mrs. Cadwallader, almost before the last word was off her friend’s
tongue. “It is frightful—this taking to buying whistles and blowing
them in everybody’s hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at
dominoes, like poor Lord Plessy, would be more private and
bearable.”</p>
<p>“I see they are beginning to attack our friend Brooke in the
’Trumpet,’” said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as
he would have done if he had been attacked himself. “There are
tremendous sarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from
Middlemarch, who receives his own rents, and makes no returns.”</p>
<p>“I do wish Brooke would leave that off,” said Sir James, with
his little frown of annoyance.</p>
<p>“Is he really going to be put in nomination, though?” said Mr.
Cadwallader. “I saw Farebrother yesterday—he’s Whiggish himself,
hoists Brougham and Useful Knowledge; that’s the worst I know of
him;—and he says that Brooke is getting up a pretty strong party.
Bulstrode, the banker, is his foremost man. But he thinks Brooke
would come off badly at a nomination.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,“ said Sir James, with earnestness. ”I have been
inquiring into the thing, for I’ve never known anything about
Middlemarch politics before—the county being my business. What
Brooke trusts to, is that they are going to turn out Oliver because
he is a Peelite. But Hawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at
all it is sure to be Bagster, one of those candidates who come from
heaven knows where, but dead against Ministers, and an experienced
Parliamentary man. Hawley’s rather rough: he forgot that he was
speaking to me. He said if Brooke wanted a pelting, he could get it
cheaper than by going to the hustings.“</p>
<p>“I warned you all of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her
hands outward. “I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to
make a splash in the mud. And now he has done it.”</p>
<p>“Well, he might have taken it into his head to marry,” said the
Rector. “That would have been a graver mess than a little
flirtation with politics.”</p>
<p>“He may do that afterwards,” said Mrs. Cadwallader—“when he has
come out on the other side of the mud with an ague.”</p>
<p>“What I care for most is his own dignity,” said Sir James. “Of
course I care the more because of the family. But he’s getting on
in life now, and I don’t like to think of his exposing himself.
They will be raking up everything against him.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s no use trying any persuasion,” said the Rector.
“There’s such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in
Brooke. Have you tried him on the subject?”</p>
<p>“Well, no,” said Sir James; “I feel a delicacy in appearing to
dictate. But I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that Brooke
is making a factotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything.
I thought it as well to hear what he had to say; and he is against
Brooke’s standing this time. I think he’ll turn him round: I think
the nomination may be staved off.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. “The independent
member hasn’t got his speeches well enough by heart.”</p>
<p>“But this Ladislaw—there again is a vexatious business,” said
Sir James. “We have had him two or three times to dine at the Hall
(you have met him, by the bye) as Brooke’s guest and a relation of
Casaubon’s, thinking he was only on a flying visit. And now I find
he’s in everybody’s mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the
’Pioneer.’ There are stories going about him as a quill-driving
alien, a foreign emissary, and what not.”</p>
<p>“Casaubon won’t like that,” said the Rector.</p>
<p>“There <i>is</i> some foreign blood in Ladislaw," returned Sir
James. "I hope he won't go into extreme opinions and carry Brooke
on."</p>
<p>“Oh, he’s a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw,” said Mrs.
Cadwallader, “with his opera songs and his ready tongue. A sort of
Byronic hero—an amorous conspirator, it strikes me. And Thomas
Aquinas is not fond of him. I could see that, the day the picture
was brought.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like to begin on the subject with Casaubon,” said Sir
James. “He has more right to interfere than I. But it’s a
disagreeable affair all round. What a character for anybody with
decent connections to show himself in!—one of those newspaper
fellows! You have only to look at Keck, who manages the ’Trumpet.’
I saw him the other day with Hawley. His writing is sound enough, I
believe, but he’s such a low fellow, that I wished he had been on
the wrong side.”</p>
<p>“What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?”
said the Rector. “I don’t suppose you could get a high style of man
anywhere to be writing up interests he doesn’t really care about,
and for pay that hardly keeps him in at elbows.”</p>
<p>“Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put
a man who has a sort of connection with the family in a position of
that kind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for
accepting.”</p>
<p>“It is Aquinas’s fault,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Why didn’t he
use his interest to get Ladislaw made an attache or sent to India?
That is how families get rid of troublesome sprigs.”</p>
<p>“There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go,” said
Sir James, anxiously. “But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I
do?”</p>
<p>“Oh my dear Sir James,” said the Rector, “don’t let us make too
much of all this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. After a
month or two Brooke and this Master Ladislaw will get tired of each
other; Ladislaw will take wing; Brooke will sell the ’Pioneer,’ and
everything will settle down again as usual.”</p>
<p>“There is one good chance—that he will not like to feel his
money oozing away,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “If I knew the items of
election expenses I could scare him. It’s no use plying him with
wide words like Expenditure: I wouldn’t talk of phlebotomy, I would
empty a pot of leeches upon him. What we good stingy people don’t
like, is having our sixpences sucked away from us.”</p>
<p>“And he will not like having things raked up against him,” said
Sir James. “There is the management of his estate. They have begun
upon that already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a
nuisance under one’s very nose. I do think one is bound to do the
best for one’s land and tenants, especially in these hard
times.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps the ’Trumpet’ may rouse him to make a change, and some
good may come of it all,” said the Rector. “I know I should be
glad. I should hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don’t
know what I should do if there were not a modus in Tipton.”</p>
<p>“I want him to have a proper man to look after things—I want him
to take on Garth again,” said Sir James. “He got rid of Garth
twelve years ago, and everything has been going wrong since. I
think of getting Garth to manage for me—he has made such a capital
plan for my buildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But
Garth would not undertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke
left it entirely to him.”</p>
<p>“In the right of it too,” said the Rector. “Garth is an
independent fellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day,
when he was doing some valuation for me, he told me point-blank
that clergymen seldom understood anything about business, and did
mischief when they meddled; but he said it as quietly and
respectfully as if he had been talking to me about sailors. He
would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke would let him
manage. I wish, by the help of the ’Trumpet,’ you could bring that
round.”</p>
<p>“If Dorothea had kept near her uncle, there would have been some
chance,” said Sir James. “She might have got some power over him in
time, and she was always uneasy about the estate. She had
wonderfully good notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes
her up entirely. Celia complains a good deal. We can hardly get her
to dine with us, since he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a
look of pitying disgust, and Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her
shoulders as much as to say that <i>she</i> was not likely to see
anything new in that direction.</p>
<p>“Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I
thought he looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”</p>
<p>“In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on
“fits,“ ”Brooke doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else,
but he has got that way of paring and clipping at expenses.“</p>
<p>“Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps
him to find himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions,
but he does know his own pocket.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,”
said Sir James.</p>
<p>“Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do
to keep one’s own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen
to look out of the window. “But talk of an independent politician
and he will appear.”</p>
<p>“What! Brooke?” said her husband.</p>
<p>“Yes. Now, you ply him with the ’Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will
put the leeches on him. What will you do, Sir James?”</p>
<p>“The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our
mutual position; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people
would behave like gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that
this was a simple and comprehensive programme for social
well-being.</p>
<p>“Here you all are, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, shuffling round and
shaking hands. “I was going up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But
it’s pleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, what do you think
of things?—going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte
said—’Since yesterday, a century has passed away:’—they’re in the
next century, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on
faster than we are.”</p>
<p>“Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is
the ’Trumpet’ accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”</p>
<p>“Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and
hastily adjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper
in his hand, saying, with a smile in his eyes—</p>
<p>“Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles
from Middlemarch, who receives his own rents. They say he is the
most retrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught
them that word in the ’Pioneer.’”</p>
<p>“Oh, that is Keek—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive,
now! Come, that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they
want to make me out a destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with
that cheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary’s
ignorance.</p>
<p>“I think he knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp
stroke or two. If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in
the most evil sense of the word—we should say, he is one who would
dub himself a reformer of our constitution, while every interest
for which he is immediately responsible is going to decay: a
philanthropist who cannot bear one rogue to be hanged, but does not
mind five honest tenants being half-starved: a man who shrieks at
corruption, and keeps his farms at rack-rent: who roars himself red
at rotten boroughs, and does not mind if every field on his farms
has a rotten gate: a man very open-hearted to Leeds and Manchester,
no doubt; he would give any number of representatives who will pay
for their seats out of their own pockets: what he objects to
giving, is a little return on rent-days to help a tenant to buy
stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather out at a
tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like an
Irish cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a
philanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the
square of the distance. And so on. All the rest is to show what
sort of legislator a philanthropist is likely to make,” ended the
Rector, throwing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the back
of his head, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused
neutrality.</p>
<p>“Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up
the paper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor
did, but coloring and smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring
himself red at rotten boroughs—I never made a speech about rotten
boroughs in my life. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of
thing—these men never understand what is good satire. Satire, you
know, should be true up to a certain point. I recollect they said
that in ’The Edinburgh’ somewhere—it must be true up to a certain
point.”</p>
<p>“Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James,
anxious to tread carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day
that he hadn’t got a decent gate on his farm. Garth has invented a
new pattern of gate—I wish you would try it. One ought to use some
of one’s timber in that way.”</p>
<p>“You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr.
Brooke, appearing to glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.“
“That’s your hobby, and you don’t mind the expense.”</p>
<p>“I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing
for Parliament,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last
unsuccessful candidate at Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent
ten thousand pounds and failed because he did not bribe enough.
What a bitter reflection for a man!”</p>
<p>“Somebody was saying,” said the Rector, laughingly, “that East
Retford was nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”</p>
<p>“Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you
know: Hawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and
that sort of thing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll.
But they are not going to have it their own way in future—not in
future, you know. Middlemarch is a little backward, I admit—the
freemen are a little backward. But we shall educate them—we shall
bring them on, you know. The best people there are on our
side.”</p>
<p>“Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,”
remarked Sir James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you
harm.”</p>
<p>“And that if you got pelted,” interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, “half
the rotten eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good
heavens! Think what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And
I seem to remember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let
him fall into a dust-heap on purpose!”</p>
<p>“Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said
the Rector. “I confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we
parsons had to stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be
afraid of their reckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I
think the truth is the hardest missile one can be pelted with.”</p>
<p>“The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life
he must be prepared for the consequences. He must make himself
proof against calumny.”</p>
<p>“My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke. “But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You
should read history—look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and
that kind of thing. They always happen to the best men, you know.
But what is that in Horace?—’fiat justitia, ruat … something
or other.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,“ said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual.
”What I mean by being proof against calumny is being able to point
to the fact as a contradiction.“</p>
<p>“And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into
one’s self,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.</p>
<p>But it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr.
Brooke. “Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his
hat and leaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system.
You are all for outlay with your farms. I don’t want to make out
that my system is good under all circumstances—under all
circumstances, you know.”</p>
<p>“There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said
Sir James. “Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair
valuation. What do you say, Cadwallader?”</p>
<p>“I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ’Trumpet’
at once by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and
giving him carte blanche about gates and repairs: that’s my view of
the political situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by
sticking his thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr.
Brooke.</p>
<p>“That’s a showy sort of thing to do, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.
“But I should like you to tell me of another landlord who has
distressed his tenants for arrears as little as I have. I let the
old tenants stay on. I’m uncommonly easy, let me tell you,
uncommonly easy. I have my own ideas, and I take my stand on them,
you know. A man who does that is always charged with eccentricity,
inconsistency, and that kind of thing. When I change my line of
action, I shall follow my own ideas.”</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which
he had omitted to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody
hurriedly good-by.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James;
“I see he is nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in
point of fact no new tenant would take the farms on the present
terms.”</p>
<p>“I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said
the Rector. “But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were
pulling another. You wanted to frighten him away from expense, and
we want to frighten him into it. Better let him try to be popular
and see that his character as a landlord stands in his way. I don’t
think it signifies two straws about the ’Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or
Brooke’s speechifying to the Middlemarchers. But it does signify
about the parishioners in Tipton being comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack,” said Mrs.
Cadwallader. “You should have proved to him that he loses money by
bad management, and then we should all have pulled together. If you
put him a-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It
was all very well to ride on sticks at home and call them
ideas.”</p>
