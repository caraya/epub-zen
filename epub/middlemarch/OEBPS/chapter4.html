<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">“S</span>ir James seems determined to do everything you wish," said
Celia, as they were driving home from an inspection of the new
building-site.</p>
<p>“He is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would
imagine,” said Dorothea, inconsiderately.</p>
<p>“You mean that he appears silly.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Dorothea, recollecting herself, and laying her
hand on her sister’s a moment, “but he does not talk equally well
on all subjects.”</p>
<p>“I should think none but disagreeable people do,” said Celia, in
her usual purring way. “They must be very dreadful to live with.
Only think! at breakfast, and always.”</p>
<p>Dorothea laughed. “O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!” She
pinched Celia’s chin, being in the mood now to think her very
winning and lovely—fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it
were not doctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of
salvation than a squirrel. “Of course people need not be always
talking well. Only one tells the quality of their minds when they
try to talk well.”</p>
<p>“You mean that Sir James tries and fails.”</p>
<p>“I was speaking generally. Why do you catechise me about Sir
James? It is not the object of his life to please me.”</p>
<p>“Now, Dodo, can you really believe that?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. He thinks of me as a future sister—that is all.”
Dorothea had never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain
shyness on such subjects which was mutual between the sisters,
until it should be introduced by some decisive event. Celia
blushed, but said at once—</p>
<p>“Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Dodo. When Tantripp
was brushing my hair the other day, she said that Sir James’s man
knew from Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid that Sir James was to marry the
eldest Miss Brooke.”</p>
<p>“How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?” said
Dorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in
her memory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation.
“You must have asked her questions. It is degrading.”</p>
<p>“I see no harm at all in Tantripp’s talking to me. It is better
to hear what people say. You see what mistakes you make by taking
up notions. I am quite sure that Sir James means to make you an
offer; and he believes that you will accept him, especially since
you have been so pleased with him about the plans. And uncle too—I
know he expects it. Every one can see that Sir James is very much
in love with you.”</p>
<p>The revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea’s mind that
the tears welled up and flowed abundantly. All her dear plans were
embittered, and she thought with disgust of Sir James’s conceiving
that she recognized him as her lover. There was vexation too on
account of Celia.</p>
<p>“How could he expect it?” she burst forth in her most impetuous
manner. “I have never agreed with him about anything but the
cottages: I was barely polite to him before.”</p>
<p>“But you have been so pleased with him since then; he has begun
to feel quite sure that you are fond of him.”</p>
<p>“Fond of him, Celia! How can you choose such odious
expressions?” said Dorothea, passionately.</p>
<p>“Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be
fond of a man whom you accepted for a husband.”</p>
<p>“It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was
fond of him. Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I
must have towards the man I would accept as a husband.”</p>
<p>“Well, I am sorry for Sir James. I thought it right to tell you,
because you went on as you always do, never looking just where you
are, and treading in the wrong place. You always see what nobody
else sees; it is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what
is quite plain. That’s your way, Dodo.” Something certainly gave
Celia unusual courage; and she was not sparing the sister of whom
she was occasionally in awe. Who can tell what just criticisms Murr
the Cat may be passing on us beings of wider speculation?</p>
<p>“It is very painful,” said Dorothea, feeling scourged. “I can
have no more to do with the cottages. I must be uncivil to him. I
must tell him I will have nothing to do with them. It is very
painful.” Her eyes filled again with tears.</p>
<p>“Wait a little. Think about it. You know he is going away for a
day or two to see his sister. There will be nobody besides
Lovegood.” Celia could not help relenting. “Poor Dodo,” she went
on, in an amiable staccato. “It is very hard: it is your favorite
<i>fad</i> to draw plans."</p>
<p>“<i>Fad</i> to draw plans! Do you think I only care about my
fellow-creatures' houses in that childish way? I may well make
mistakes. How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living
among people with such petty thoughts?"</p>
<p>No more was said; Dorothea was too much jarred to recover her
temper and behave so as to show that she admitted any error in
herself. She was disposed rather to accuse the intolerable
narrowness and the purblind conscience of the society around her:
and Celia was no longer the eternal cherub, but a thorn in her
spirit, a pink-and-white nullifidian, worse than any discouraging
presence in the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” The <i>fad</i> of drawing
plans! What was life worth—what great faith was possible when the
whole effect of one's actions could be withered up into such
parched rubbish as that? When she got out of the carriage, her
cheeks were pale and her eyelids red. She was an image of sorrow,
and her uncle who met her in the hall would have been alarmed, if
Celia had not been close to her looking so pretty and composed,
that he at once concluded Dorothea's tears to have their origin in
her excessive religiousness. He had returned, during their absence,
from a journey to the county town, about a petition for the pardon
of some criminal.</p>
<p>“Well, my dears,” he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him,
“I hope nothing disagreeable has happened while I have been
away.”</p>
<p>“No, uncle,” said Celia, “we have been to Freshitt to look at
the cottages. We thought you would have been at home to lunch.”</p>
<p>“I came by Lowick to lunch—you didn’t know I came by Lowick. And
I have brought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea—in the
library, you know; they lie on the table in the library.”</p>
<p>It seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea,
thrilling her from despair into expectation. They were pamphlets
about the early Church. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir
James was shaken off, and she walked straight to the library. Celia
went up-stairs. Mr. Brooke was detained by a message, but when he
re-entered the library, he found Dorothea seated and already deep
in one of the pamphlets which had some marginal manuscript of Mr.
Casaubon’s,—taking it in as eagerly as she might have taken in the
scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry, hot, dreary walk.</p>
<p>She was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her own sad
liability to tread in the wrong places on her way to the New
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke sat down in his arm-chair, stretched his legs towards
the wood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing
dice between the dogs, and rubbed his hands gently, looking very
mildly towards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he
had nothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her pamphlet, as
soon as she was aware of her uncle’s presence, and rose as if to
go. Usually she would have been interested about her uncle’s
merciful errand on behalf of the criminal, but her late agitation
had made her absent-minded.</p>
<p>“I came back by Lowick, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not as if
with any intention to arrest her departure, but apparently from his
usual tendency to say what he had said before. This fundamental
principle of human speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. “I
lunched there and saw Casaubon’s library, and that kind of thing.
There’s a sharp air, driving. Won’t you sit down, my dear? You look
cold.”</p>
<p>Dorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some
times, when her uncle’s easy way of taking things did not happen to
be exasperating, it was rather soothing. She threw off her mantle
and bonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but
lifting up her beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin
hands, or small hands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She
seemed to be holding them up in propitiation for her passionate
desire to know and to think, which in the unfriendly mediums of
Tipton and Freshitt had issued in crying and red eyelids.</p>
<p>She bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. “What news
have you brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?”</p>
<p>“What, poor Bunch?—well, it seems we can’t get him off—he is to
be hanged.”</p>
<p>Dorothea’s brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.</p>
<p>“Hanged, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with a quiet nod. “Poor
Romilly! he would have helped us. I knew Romilly. Casaubon didn’t
know Romilly. He is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon
is.”</p>
<p>“When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, he
must of course give up seeing much of the world. How can he go
about making acquaintances?”</p>
<p>“That’s true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a
bachelor too, but I have that sort of disposition that I never
moped; it was my way to go about everywhere and take in everything.
I never moped: but I can see that Casaubon does, you know. He wants
a companion—a companion, you know.”</p>
<p>“It would be a great honor to any one to be his companion,” said
Dorothea, energetically.</p>
<p>“You like him, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, without showing any
surprise, or other emotion. “Well, now, I’ve known Casaubon ten
years, ever since he came to Lowick. But I never got anything out
of him—any ideas, you know. However, he is a tiptop man and may be
a bishop—that kind of thing, you know, if Peel stays in. And he has
a very high opinion of you, my dear.”</p>
<p>Dorothea could not speak.</p>
<p>“The fact is, he has a very high opinion indeed of you. And he
speaks uncommonly well—does Casaubon. He has deferred to me, you
not being of age. In short, I have promised to speak to you, though
I told him I thought there was not much chance. I was bound to tell
him that. I said, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing.
But I didn’t think it necessary to go into everything. However, the
long and the short of it is, that he has asked my permission to
make you an offer of marriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke, with his explanatory nod. “I thought it better to tell you,
my dear.”</p>
<p>No one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke’s manner,
but he did really wish to know something of his niece’s mind, that,
if there were any need for advice, he might give it in time. What
feeling he, as a magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could
make room for, was unmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak
immediately, he repeated, “I thought it better to tell you, my
dear.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, uncle,” said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone.
“I am very grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I
shall accept him. I admire and honor him more than any man I ever
saw.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low
tone, “Ah? … Well! He is a good match in some respects. But
now, Chettam is a good match. And our land lies together. I shall
never interfere against your wishes, my dear. People should have
their own way in marriage, and that sort of thing—up to a certain
point, you know. I have always said that, up to a certain point. I
wish you to marry well; and I have good reason to believe that
Chettam wishes to marry you. I mention it, you know.”</p>
<p>“It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,”
said Dorothea. “If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great
mistake.”</p>
<p>“That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought
Chettam was just the sort of man a woman would like, now.”</p>
<p>“Pray do not mention him in that light again, uncle,” said
Dorothea, feeling some of her late irritation revive.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible
subject of study, since even he at his age was not in a perfect
state of scientific prediction about them. Here was a fellow like
Chettam with no chance at all.</p>
<p>“Well, but Casaubon, now. There is no hurry—I mean for you. It’s
true, every year will tell upon him. He is over five-and-forty, you
know. I should say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you. To
be sure,—if you like learning and standing, and that sort of thing,
we can’t have everything. And his income is good—he has a handsome
property independent of the Church—his income is good. Still he is
not young, and I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think
his health is not over-strong. I know nothing else against
him.”</p>
<p>“I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,” said
Dorothea, with grave decision. “I should wish to have a husband who
was above me in judgment and in all knowledge.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke repeated his subdued, “Ah?—I thought you had more of
your own opinion than most girls. I thought you liked your own
opinion—liked it, you know.”</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine myself living without some opinions, but I
should wish to have good reasons for them, and a wise man could
help me to see which opinions had the best foundation, and would
help me to live according to them.”</p>
<p>“Very true. You couldn’t put the thing better—couldn’t put it
better, beforehand, you know. But there are oddities in things,”
continued Mr. Brooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the
best he could for his niece on this occasion. “Life isn’t cast in a
mould—not cut out by rule and line, and that sort of thing. I never
married myself, and it will be the better for you and yours. The
fact is, I never loved any one well enough to put myself into a
noose for them. It <i>is</i> a noose, you know. Temper, now. There
is temper. And a husband likes to be master."</p>
<p>“I know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of
higher duties. I never thought of it as mere personal ease,” said
poor Dorothea.</p>
<p>“Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls,
dinners, that kind of thing. I can see that Casaubon’s ways might
suit you better than Chettam’s. And you shall do as you like, my
dear. I would not hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is
no knowing how anything may turn out. You have not the same tastes
as every young lady; and a clergyman and scholar—who may be a
bishop—that kind of thing—may suit you better than Chettam. Chettam
is a good fellow, a good sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he
doesn’t go much into ideas. I did, when I was his age. But
Casaubon’s eyes, now. I think he has hurt them a little with too
much reading.”</p>
<p>“I should be all the happier, uncle, the more room there was for
me to help him,” said Dorothea, ardently.</p>
<p>“You have quite made up your mind, I see. Well, my dear, the
fact is, I have a letter for you in my pocket.” Mr. Brooke handed
the letter to Dorothea, but as she rose to go away, he added,
“There is not too much hurry, my dear. Think about it, you
know.”</p>
<p>When Dorothea had left him, he reflected that he had certainly
spoken strongly: he had put the risks of marriage before her in a
striking manner. It was his duty to do so. But as to pretending to
be wise for young people,—no uncle, however much he had travelled
in his youth, absorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities
now deceased, could pretend to judge what sort of marriage would
turn out well for a young girl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam.
In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke’s mind felt
blank before it, could be hardly less complicated than the
revolutions of an irregular solid.</p>
