<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">It</span> was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill: that
explains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the
lawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall, holding the
"Times" in his hands behind him, while he talked with a
trout-fisher's dispassionateness about the prospects of the country
to Sir James Chettam. Mrs. Cadwallader, the Dowager Lady Chettam,
and Celia were sometimes seated on garden-chairs, sometimes walking
to meet little Arthur, who was being drawn in his chariot, and, as
became the infantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his sacred umbrella
with handsome silken fringe.</p>
<p>The ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs.
Cadwallader was strong on the intended creation of peers: she had
it for certain from her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the
other side entirely at the instigation of his wife, who had scented
peerages in the air from the very first introduction of the Reform
question, and would sign her soul away to take precedence of her
younger sister, who had married a baronet. Lady Chettam thought
that such conduct was very reprehensible, and remembered that Mrs.
Truberry’s mother was a Miss Walsingham of Melspring. Celia
confessed it was nicer to be “Lady“ than ”Mrs.,” and that Dodo
never minded about precedence if she could have her own way. Mrs.
Cadwallader held that it was a poor satisfaction to take precedence
when everybody about you knew that you had not a drop of good blood
in your veins; and Celia again, stopping to look at Arthur, said,
“It would be very nice, though, if he were a Viscount—and his
lordship’s little tooth coming through! He might have been, if
James had been an Earl.”</p>
<p>“My dear Celia,” said the Dowager, “James’s title is worth far
more than any new earldom. I never wished his father to be anything
else than Sir James.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I only meant about Arthur’s little tooth,” said Celia,
comfortably. “But see, here is my uncle coming.”</p>
<p>She tripped off to meet her uncle, while Sir James and Mr.
Cadwallader came forward to make one group with the ladies. Celia
had slipped her arm through her uncle’s, and he patted her hand
with a rather melancholy “Well, my dear!” As they approached, it
was evident that Mr. Brooke was looking dejected, but this was
fully accounted for by the state of politics; and as he was shaking
hands all round without more greeting than a “Well, you’re all
here, you know,” the Rector said, laughingly—</p>
<p>“Don’t take the throwing out of the Bill so much to heart,
Brooke; you’ve got all the riff-raff of the country on your
side.”</p>
<p>“The Bill, eh? ah!” said Mr. Brooke, with a mild distractedness
of manner. “Thrown out, you know, eh? The Lords are going too far,
though. They’ll have to pull up. Sad news, you know. I mean, here
at home—sad news. But you must not blame me, Chettam.”</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” said Sir James. “Not another gamekeeper
shot, I hope? It’s what I should expect, when a fellow like
Trapping Bass is let off so easily.”</p>
<p>“Gamekeeper? No. Let us go in; I can tell you all in the house,
you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding at the Cadwalladers, to show
that he included them in his confidence. “As to poachers like
Trapping Bass, you know, Chettam,” he continued, as they were
entering, “when you are a magistrate, you’ll not find it so easy to
commit. Severity is all very well, but it’s a great deal easier
when you’ve got somebody to do it for you. You have a soft place in
your heart yourself, you know—you’re not a Draco, a Jeffreys, that
sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation.
When he had something painful to tell, it was usually his way to
introduce it among a number of disjointed particulars, as if it
were a medicine that would get a milder flavor by mixing. He
continued his chat with Sir James about the poachers until they
were all seated, and Mrs. Cadwallader, impatient of this
drivelling, said—</p>
<p>“I’m dying to know the sad news. The gamekeeper is not shot:
that is settled. What is it, then?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a very trying thing, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.
“I’m glad you and the Rector are here; it’s a family matter—but you
will help us all to bear it, Cadwallader. I’ve got to break it to
you, my dear.” Here Mr. Brooke looked at Celia—“You’ve no notion
what it is, you know. And, Chettam, it will annoy you
uncommonly—but, you see, you have not been able to hinder it, any
more than I have. There’s something singular in things: they come
round, you know.”</p>
<p>“It must be about Dodo,” said Celia, who had been used to think
of her sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. She
had seated herself on a low stool against her husband’s knee. fx
“For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it
was a sort of will to make things worse.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,“ said Sir James, hastily. ”But <i>what</i> is
worse?"</p>
<p>“Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke, nodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her
husband with a frightened glance, and put her hand on his knee. Sir
James was almost white with anger, but he did not speak.</p>
<p>“Merciful heaven!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Not to <i>young</i>
Ladislaw?"</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke nodded, saying, “Yes; to Ladislaw,” and then fell
into a prudential silence.</p>
<p>“You see, Humphrey!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her arm
towards her husband. “Another time you will admit that I have some
foresight; or rather you will contradict me and be just as blind as
ever. <i>You</i> supposed that the young gentleman was gone out of
the country."</p>
<p>“So he might be, and yet come back,” said the Rector,
quietly</p>
<p>“When did you learn this?” said Sir James, not liking to hear
any one else speak, though finding it difficult to speak
himself.</p>
<p>“Yesterday,“ said Mr. Brooke, meekly. ”I went to Lowick.
Dorothea sent for me, you know. It had come about quite
suddenly—neither of them had any idea two days ago—not any idea,
you know. There’s something singular in things. But Dorothea is
quite determined—it is no use opposing. I put it strongly to her. I
did my duty, Chettam. But she can act as she likes, you know.“</p>
<p>“It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him
a year ago,” said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but
because he needed something strong to say.</p>
<p>“Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,” said
Celia.</p>
<p>“Be reasonable, Chettam. Look at the affair more quietly,” said
Mr. Cadwallader, sorry to see his good-natured friend so
overmastered by anger.</p>
<p>“That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any
sense of right—when the affair happens to be in his own family,”
said Sir James, still in his white indignation. “It is perfectly
scandalous. If Ladislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone
out of the country at once, and never shown his face in it again.
However, I am not surprised. The day after Casaubon’s funeral I
said what ought to be done. But I was not listened to.”</p>
<p>“You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,” said Mr.
Brooke. “You wanted him shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to
be done as we liked with: he had his ideas. He was a remarkable
fellow—I always said he was a remarkable fellow.”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, ”it is rather
a pity you formed that high opinion of him. We are indebted to that
for his being lodged in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that
for seeing a woman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying
him.“ Sir James made little stoppages between his clauses, the
words not coming easily. ”A man so marked out by her husband’s
will, that delicacy ought to have forbidden her from seeing him
again—who takes her out of her proper rank—into poverty—has the
meanness to accept such a sacrifice—has always had an objectionable
position—a bad origin—and, I <i>believe</i>, is a man of little
principle and light character. That is my opinion." Sir James ended
emphatically, turning aside and crossing his leg.</p>
<p>“I pointed everything out to her,” said Mr. Brooke,
apologetically—“I mean the poverty, and abandoning her position. I
said, ’My dear, you don’t know what it is to live on seven hundred
a-year, and have no carriage, and that kind of thing, and go
amongst people who don’t know who you are.’ I put it strongly to
her. But I advise you to talk to Dorothea herself. The fact is, she
has a dislike to Casaubon’s property. You will hear what she says,
you know.”</p>
<p>“No—excuse me—I shall not,” said Sir James, with more coolness.
“I cannot bear to see her again; it is too painful. It hurts me too
much that a woman like Dorothea should have done what is
wrong.”</p>
<p>“Be just, Chettam,” said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who
objected to all this unnecessary discomfort. “Mrs. Casaubon may be
acting imprudently: she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a
man, and we men have so poor an opinion of each other that we can
hardly call a woman wise who does that. But I think you should not
condemn it as a wrong action, in the strict sense of the word.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” answered Sir James. “I think that Dorothea commits
a wrong action in marrying Ladislaw.”</p>
<p>“My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong
because it is unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly. Like
many men who take life easily, he had the knack of saying a home
truth occasionally to those who felt themselves virtuously out of
temper. Sir James took out his handkerchief and began to bite the
corner.</p>
<p>“It is very dreadful of Dodo, though,” said Celia, wishing to
justify her husband. “She said she <i>never would</i> marry
again—not anybody at all."</p>
<p>“I heard her say the same thing myself,” said Lady Chettam,
majestically, as if this were royal evidence.</p>
<p>“Oh, there is usually a silent exception in such cases,” said
Mrs. Cadwallader. “The only wonder to me is, that any of you are
surprised. You did nothing to hinder it. If you would have had Lord
Triton down here to woo her with his philanthropy, he might have
carried her off before the year was over. There was no safety in
anything else. Mr. Casaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as
possible. He made himself disagreeable—or it pleased God to make
him so—and then he dared her to contradict him. It’s the way to
make any trumpery tempting, to ticket it at a high price in that
way.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean by wrong, Cadwallader,” said Sir
James, still feeling a little stung, and turning round in his chair
towards the Rector. “He’s not a man we can take into the family. At
least, I must speak for myself,” he continued, carefully keeping
his eyes off Mr. Brooke. “I suppose others will find his society
too pleasant to care about the propriety of the thing.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly,
nursing his leg, “I can’t turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a
father to her up to a certain point. I said, ’My dear, I won’t
refuse to give you away.’ I had spoken strongly before. But I can
cut off the entail, you know. It will cost money and be
troublesome; but I can do it, you know.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke nodded at Sir James, and felt that he was both
showing his own force of resolution and propitiating what was just
in the Baronet’s vexation. He had hit on a more ingenious mode of
parrying than he was aware of. He had touched a motive of which Sir
James was ashamed. The mass of his feeling about Dorothea’s
marriage to Ladislaw was due partly to excusable prejudice, or even
justifiable opinion, partly to a jealous repugnance hardly less in
Ladislaw’s case than in Casaubon’s. He was convinced that the
marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea. But amid that mass ran a
vein of which he was too good and honorable a man to like the
avowal even to himself: it was undeniable that the union of the two
estates—Tipton and Freshitt—lying charmingly within a ring-fence,
was a prospect that flattered him for his son and heir. Hence when
Mr. Brooke noddingly appealed to that motive, Sir James felt a
sudden embarrassment; there was a stoppage in his throat; he even
blushed. He had found more words than usual in the first jet of his
anger, but Mr. Brooke’s propitiation was more clogging to his
tongue than Mr. Cadwallader’s caustic hint.</p>
<p>But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle’s
suggestion of the marriage ceremony, and she said, though with as
little eagerness of manner as if the question had turned on an
invitation to dinner, “Do you mean that Dodo is going to be married
directly, uncle?”</p>
<p>“In three weeks, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, helplessly. “I can
do nothing to hinder it, Cadwallader,” he added, turning for a
little countenance toward the Rector, who said—</p>
<p>“—I—should not make any fuss about it. If she likes to be poor,
that is her affair. Nobody would have said anything if she had
married the young fellow because he was rich. Plenty of beneficed
clergy are poorer than they will be. Here is Elinor,” continued the
provoking husband; “she vexed her friends by me: I had hardly a
thousand a-year—I was a lout—nobody could see anything in me—my
shoes were not the right cut—all the men wondered how a woman could
like me. Upon my word, I must take Ladislaw’s part until I hear
more harm of him.”</p>
<p>“Humphrey, that is all sophistry, and you know it,” said his
wife. “Everything is all one—that is the beginning and end with
you. As if you had not been a Cadwallader! Does any one suppose
that I would have taken such a monster as you by any other
name?”</p>
<p>“And a clergyman too,” observed Lady Chettam with approbation.
“Elinor cannot be said to have descended below her rank. It is
difficult to say what Mr. Ladislaw is, eh, James?”</p>
<p>Sir James gave a small grunt, which was less respectful than his
usual mode of answering his mother. Celia looked up at him like a
thoughtful kitten.</p>
<p>“It must be admitted that his blood is a frightful mixture!”
said Mrs. Cadwallader. “The Casaubon cuttle-fish fluid to begin
with, and then a rebellious Polish fiddler or dancing-master, was
it?—and then an old clo—”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Elinor,” said the Rector, rising. “It is time for us
to go.”</p>
<p>“After all, he is a pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, rising
too, and wishing to make amends. “He is like the fine old Crichley
portraits before the idiots came in.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you,” said Mr. Brooke, starting up with alacrity.
“You must all come and dine with me to-morrow, you know—eh, Celia,
my dear?”</p>
<p>“You will, James—won’t you?” said Celia, taking her husband’s
hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course, if you like,” said Sir James, pulling down his
waistcoat, but unable yet to adjust his face good-humoredly. “That
is to say, if it is not to meet anybody else.’:</p>
<p>“No, no, no,” said Mr. Brooke, understanding the condition.
“Dorothea would not come, you know, unless you had been to see
her.”</p>
<p>When Sir James and Celia were alone, she said, “Do you mind
about my having the carriage to go to, Lowick, James?”</p>
<p>“What, now, directly?” he answered, with some surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is very important,” said Celia.</p>
<p>“Remember, Celia, I cannot see her,” said Sir James.</p>
<p>“Not if she gave up marrying?”</p>
<p>“What is the use of saying that?—however, I’m going to the
stables. I’ll tell Briggs to bring the carriage round.”</p>
<p>Celia thought it was of great use, if not to say that, at least
to take a journey to Lowick in order to influence Dorothea’s mind.
All through their girlhood she had felt that she could act on her
sister by a word judiciously placed—by opening a little window for
the daylight of her own understanding to enter among the strange
colored lamps by which Dodo habitually saw. And Celia the matron
naturally felt more able to advise her childless sister. How could
any one understand Dodo so well as Celia did or love her so
tenderly?</p>
<p>Dorothea, busy in her boudoir, felt a glow of pleasure at the
sight of her sister so soon after the revelation of her intended
marriage. She had prefigured to herself, even with exaggeration,
the disgust of her friends, and she had even feared that Celia
might be kept aloof from her.</p>
<p>“O Kitty, I am delighted to see you!” said Dorothea, putting her
hands on Celia’s shoulders, and beaming on her. “I almost thought
you would not come to me.”</p>
<p>“I have not brought Arthur, because I was in a hurry,” said
Celia, and they sat down on two small chairs opposite each other,
with their knees touching.</p>
<p>“You know, Dodo, it is very bad,” said Celia, in her placid
guttural, looking as prettily free from humors as possible. “You
have disappointed us all so. And I can’t think that it ever
<i>will</i> be—you never can go and live in that way. And then
there are all your plans! You never can have thought of that. James
would have taken any trouble for you, and you might have gone on
all your life doing what you liked."</p>
<p>“On the contrary, dear,” said Dorothea, “I never could do
anything that I liked. I have never carried out any plan yet.”</p>
<p>“Because you always wanted things that wouldn’t do. But other
plans would have come. And how can you marry Mr. Ladislaw, that we
none of us ever thought you <i>could</i> marry? It shocks James so
dreadfully. And then it is all so different from what you have
always been. You would have Mr. Casaubon because he had such a
great soul, and was so and dismal and learned; and now, to think of
marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has got no estate or anything. I suppose
it is because you must be making yourself uncomfortable in some way
or other."</p>
<p>Dorothea laughed.</p>
<p>“Well, it is very serious, Dodo,” said Celia, becoming more
impressive. “How will you live? and you will go away among queer
people. And I shall never see you—and you won’t mind about little
Arthur—and I thought you always would—”</p>
<p>Celia’s rare tears had got into her eyes, and the corners of her
mouth were agitated.</p>
<p>“Dear Celia,” said Dorothea, with tender gravity, “if you don’t
ever see me, it will not be my fault.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it will,” said Celia, with the same touching distortion of
her small features. “How can I come to you or have you with me when
James can’t bear it?—that is because he thinks it is not right—he
thinks you are so wrong, Dodo. But you always were wrong: only I
can’t help loving you. And nobody can think where you will live:
where can you go?”</p>
<p>“I am going to London,” said Dorothea.</p>
<p>“How can you always live in a street? And you will be so poor. I
could give you half my things, only how can I, when I never see
you?”</p>
<p>“Bless you, Kitty,” said Dorothea, with gentle warmth. “Take
comfort: perhaps James will forgive me some time.”</p>
<p>“But it would be much better if you would not be married,” said
Celia, drying her eyes, and returning to her argument; “then there
would be nothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody
thought you could do. James always said you ought to be a queen;
but this is not at all being like a queen. You know what mistakes
you have always been making, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody
thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper husband for you. And you <i>said
you</i> would never be married again."</p>
<p>“It is quite true that I might be a wiser person, Celia,” said
Dorothea, “and that I might have done something better, if I had
been better. But this is what I am going to do. I have promised to
marry Mr. Ladislaw; and I am going to marry him.”</p>
<p>The tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had
long learned to recognize. She was silent a few moments, and then
said, as if she had dismissed all contest, “Is he very fond of you,
Dodo?”</p>
<p>“I hope so. I am very fond of him.”</p>
<p>“That is nice,” said Celia, comfortably. “Only I rather you had
such a sort of husband as James is, with a place very near, that I
could drive to.”</p>
<p>Dorothea smiled, and Celia looked rather meditative. Presently
she said, “I cannot think how it all came about.” Celia thought it
would be pleasant to hear the story.</p>
<p>“I dare say not,” said-Dorothea, pinching her sister’s chin. “If
you knew how it came about, it would not seem wonderful to
you.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell me?” said Celia, settling her arms cozily.</p>
<p>“No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never
know.”</p>
