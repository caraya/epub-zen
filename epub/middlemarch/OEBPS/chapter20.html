<blockquote><p>
          “A child forsaken, waking suddenly,<br/>
          Whose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove,<br/>
          And seeth only that it cannot see<br/>
          The meeting eyes of love."<br/>
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>wo hours later, Dorothea was seated in an inner room or boudoir
of a handsome apartment in the Via Sistina.</p>
<p>I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such
abandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman
habitually controlled by pride on her own account and
thoughtfulness for others will sometimes allow herself when she
feels securely alone. And Mr. Casaubon was certain to remain away
for some time at the Vatican.</p>
<p>Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could
state even to herself; and in the midst of her confused thought and
passion, the mental act that was struggling forth into clearness
was a self-accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the
fault of her own spiritual poverty. She had married the man of her
choice, and with the advantage over most girls that she had
contemplated her marriage chiefly as the beginning of new duties:
from the very first she had thought of Mr. Casaubon as having a
mind so much above her own, that he must often be claimed by
studies which she could not entirely share; moreover, after the
brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was beholding Rome, the
city of visible history, where the past of a whole hemisphere seems
moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral images and
trophies gathered from afar.</p>
<p>But this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike
strangeness of her bridal life. Dorothea had now been five weeks in
Rome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to
go hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would
presently survive in chiller loneliness, she had driven about at
first with Mr. Casaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and
their experienced courier. She had been led through the best
galleries, had been taken to the chief points of view, had been
shown the grandest ruins and the most glorious churches, and she
had ended by oftenest choosing to drive out to the Campagna where
she could feel alone with the earth and sky, away-from the
oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her own life too seemed to
become a masque with enigmatical costumes.</p>
<p>To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a
knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes,
and traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all
contrasts, Rome may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter
of the world. But let them conceive one more historical contrast:
the gigantic broken revelations of that Imperial and Papal city
thrust abruptly on the notions of a girl who had been brought up in
English and Swiss Puritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories
and on art chiefly of the hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent
nature turned all her small allowance of knowledge into principles,
fusing her actions into their mould, and whose quick emotions gave
the most abstract things the quality of a pleasure or a pain; a
girl who had lately become a wife, and from the enthusiastic
acceptance of untried duty found herself plunged in tumultuous
preoccupation with her personal lot. The weight of unintelligible
Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it formed a
background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society; but
Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions. Ruins and
basilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid
present, where all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in
the deep degeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the
dimmer but yet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls
and ceilings; the long vistas of white forms whose marble eyes
seemed to hold the monotonous light of an alien world: all this
vast wreck of ambitious ideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed
confusedly with the signs of breathing forgetfulness and
degradation, at first jarred her as with an electric shock, and
then urged themselves on her with that ache belonging to a glut of
confused ideas which check the flow of emotion. Forms both pale and
glowing took possession of her young sense, and fixed themselves in
her memory even when she was not thinking of them, preparing
strange associations which remained through her after-years. Our
moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other
like the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of
dull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the
vastness of St. Peter’s, the huge bronze canopy, the excited
intention in the attitudes and garments of the prophets and
evangelists in the mosaics above, and the red drapery which was
being hung for Christmas spreading itself everywhere like a disease
of the retina.</p>
<p>Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s was anything very
exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among
incongruities and left to “find their feet” among them, while their
elders go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.
Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her
wedding, the situation will be regarded as tragic. Some
discouragement, some faintness of heart at the new real future
which replaces the imaginary, is not unusual, and we do not expect
people to be deeply moved by what is not unusual. That element of
tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency, has not yet
wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind; and perhaps our
frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had a keen vision and
feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the
grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that
roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the
quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.</p>
<p>However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to
state the cause, she could only have done so in some such general
words as I have already used: to have been driven to be more
particular would have been like trying to give a history of the
lights and shadows, for that new real future which was replacing
the imaginary drew its material from the endless minutiae by which
her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely relation, now that she was
married to him, was gradually changing with the secret motion of a
watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden dream. It was too
early yet for her fully to recognize or at least admit the change,
still more for her to have readjusted that devotedness which was so
necessary a part of her mental life that she was almost sure sooner
or later to recover it. Permanent rebellion, the disorder of a life
without some loving reverent resolve, was not possible to her; but
she was now in an interval when the very force of her nature
heightened its confusion. In this way, the early months of marriage
often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a shrimp-pool or
of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into cheerful peace.</p>
<p>But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before? Had his
forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less
laudable? Oh waywardness of womanhood! did his chronology fail him,
or his ability to state not only a theory but the names of those
who held it; or his provision for giving the heads of any subject
on demand? And was not Rome the place in all the world to give free
play to such accomplishments? Besides, had not Dorothea’s
enthusiasm especially dwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight
and perhaps the sadness with which great tasks lie on him who has
to achieve them?— And that such weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was
only plainer than before.</p>
<p>All these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the
same, the light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at
noonday. The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose
nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and
exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen
in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as
something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will
certainly not appear altogether the same. And it would be
astonishing to find how soon the change is felt if we had no
kindred changes to compare with it. To share lodgings with a
brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician in
the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these
cases too we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we
sometimes end by inverting the quantities.</p>
<p>Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more
incapable of flashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as
genuine a character as any ruminant animal, and he had not actively
assisted in creating any illusions about himself. How was it that
in the weeks since her marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly
observed but felt with a stifling depression, that the large vistas
and wide fresh air which she had dreamed of finding in her
husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages
which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that in courtship
everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and the
smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee
delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal.
But the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is
concentrated on the present. Having once embarked on your marital
voyage, it is impossible not to be aware that you make no way and
that the sea is not within sight—that, in fact, you are exploring
an enclosed basin.</p>
<p>In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often
dwelt on some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea
did not see the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to
the brokenness of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in
their future, she had listened with fervid patience to a recitation
of possible arguments to be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely
new view of the Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities,
thinking that hereafter she should see this subject which touched
him so nearly from the same high ground whence doubtless it had
become so important to him. Again, the matter-of-course statement
and tone of dismissal with which he treated what to her were the
most stirring thoughts, was easily accounted for as belonging to
the sense of haste and preoccupation in which she herself shared
during their engagement. But now, since they had been in Rome, with
all the depths of her emotion roused to tumultuous activity, and
with life made a new problem by new elements, she had been becoming
more and more aware, with a certain terror, that her mind was
continually sliding into inward fits of anger and repulsion, or
else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious Hooker or any
other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr. Casaubon’s
time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could not
have the advantage of comparison; but her husband’s way of
commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had
begun to affect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps
the best intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of
acquitting himself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his;
and such capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been
stimulated in him by the general life of mankind had long shrunk to
a sort of dried preparation, a lifeless embalmment of
knowledge.</p>
<p>When he said, “Does this interest you, Dorothea? Shall we stay a
little longer? I am ready to stay if you wish it,”—it seemed to her
as if going or staying were alike dreary. Or, “Should you like to
go to the Farnesina, Dorothea? It contains celebrated frescos
designed or painted by Raphael, which most persons think it worth
while to visit.”</p>
<p>“But do you care about them?” was always Dorothea’s
question.</p>
<p>“They are, I believe, highly esteemed. Some of them represent
the fable of Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic
invention of a literary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as
a genuine mythical product. But if you like these wall-paintings we
can easily drive thither; and you will then, I think, have seen the
chief works of Raphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a
visit to Rome. He is the painter who has been held to combine the
most complete grace of form with sublimity of expression. Such at
least I have gathered to be the opinion of cognoscenti.”</p>
<p>This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a
clergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify
the glories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if
she knew more about them the world would be joyously illuminated
for her. There is hardly any contact more depressing to a young
ardent creature than that of a mind in which years full of
knowledge seem to have issued in a blank absence of interest or
sympathy.</p>
<p>On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of
occupation and an eagerness which are usually regarded as the
effect of enthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this
spontaneous direction of his thoughts, instead of being made to
feel that she dragged him away from it. But she was gradually
ceasing to expect with her former delightful confidence that she
should see any wide opening where she followed him. Poor Mr.
Casaubon himself was lost among small closets and winding stairs,
and in an agitated dimness about the Cabeiri, or in an exposure of
other mythologists’ ill-considered parallels, easily lost sight of
any purpose which had prompted him to these labors. With his taper
stuck before him he forgot the absence of windows, and in bitter
manuscript remarks on other men’s notions about the solar deities,
he had become indifferent to the sunlight.</p>
<p>These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr.
Casaubon, might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had
been encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he
would have held her hands between his and listened with the delight
of tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which
made up her experience, and would have given her the same sort of
intimacy in return, so that the past life of each could be included
in their mutual knowledge and affection—or if she could have fed
her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of
every sweet woman, who has begun by showering kisses on the hard
pate of her bald doll, creating a happy soul within that woodenness
from the wealth of her own love. That was Dorothea’s bent. With all
her yearning to know what was afar from her and to be widely
benignant, she had ardor enough for what was near, to have kissed
Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have caressed his shoe-latchet,
if he would have made any other sign of acceptance than pronouncing
her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of a most affectionate and
truly feminine nature, indicating at the same time by politely
reaching a chair for her that he regarded these manifestations as
rather crude and startling. Having made his clerical toilet with
due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those amenities
of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat of the
period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.</p>
<p>And by a sad contradiction Dorothea’s ideas and resolves seemed
like melting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they
had been but another form. She was humiliated to find herself a
mere victim of feeling, as if she could know nothing except through
that medium: all her strength was scattered in fits of agitation,
of struggle, of despondency, and then again in visions of more
complete renunciation, transforming all hard conditions into duty.
Poor Dorothea! she was certainly troublesome—to herself chiefly;
but this morning for the first time she had been troublesome to Mr.
Casaubon.</p>
<p>She had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a
determination to shake off what she inwardly called her
selfishness, and turned a face all cheerful attention to her
husband when he said, “My dear Dorothea, we must now think of all
that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to our departure. I would
fain have returned home earlier that we might have been at Lowick
for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been protracted
beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the time
here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of
Europe, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking
and in some respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it
an epoch in my life when I visited it for the first time; after the
fall of Napoleon, an event which opened the Continent to
travellers. Indeed I think it is one among several cities to which
an extreme hyperbole has been applied—’See Rome and die:’ but in
your case I would propose an emendation and say, See Rome as a
bride, and live henceforth as a happy wife.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most
conscientious intention, blinking a little and swaying his head up
and down, and concluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a
rapturous state, but he had no idea of being anything else than an
irreproachable husband, who would make a charming young woman as
happy as she deserved to be.</p>
<p>“I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with
the result so far as your studies are concerned,” said Dorothea,
trying to keep her mind fixed on what most affected her
husband.</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice
which makes the word half a negative. ”I have been led farther than
I had foreseen, and various subjects for annotation have presented
themselves which, though I have no direct need of them, I could not
pretermit. The task, notwithstanding the assistance of my
amanuensis, has been a somewhat laborious one, but your society has
happily prevented me from that too continuous prosecution of
thought beyond the hours of study which has been the snare of my
solitary life.“</p>
<p>“I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to
you,” said Dorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which
she had supposed that Mr. Casaubon’s mind had gone too deep during
the day to be able to get to the surface again. I fear there was a
little temper in her reply. “I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall
be more useful to you, and be able to enter a little more into what
interests you.”</p>
<p>“Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. “The
notes I have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you
please, extract them under my direction.”</p>
<p>“And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already
burned within her on this subject, so that now she could not help
speaking with her tongue. “All those rows of volumes—will you not
now do what you used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind
what part of them you will use, and begin to write the book which
will make your vast knowledge useful to the world? I will write to
your dictation, or I will copy and extract what you tell me: I can
be of no other use.” Dorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly
feminine manner, ended with a slight sob and eyes full of
tears.</p>
<p>The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly
disturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why
Dorothea’s words were among the most cutting and irritating to him
that she could have been impelled to use. She was as blind to his
inward troubles as he to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden
conflicts in her husband which claim our pity. She had not yet
listened patiently to his heartbeats, but only felt that her own
was beating violently. In Mr. Casaubon’s ear, Dorothea’s voice gave
loud emphatic iteration to those muffled suggestions of
consciousness which it was possible to explain as mere fancy, the
illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness: always when such suggestions
are unmistakably repeated from without, they are resisted as cruel
and unjust. We are angered even by the full acceptance of our
humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in hard distinct
syllables from the lips of a near observer, those confused murmurs
which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if they were the
oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was there in
the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of
observing his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with
the uncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to
present herself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of
inference. Here, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr.
Casaubon had a sensitiveness to match Dorothea’s, and an equal
quickness to imagine more than the fact. He had formerly observed
with approbation her capacity for worshipping the right object; he
now foresaw with sudden terror that this capacity might be replaced
by presumption, this worship by the most exasperating of all
criticism,—that which sees vaguely a great many fine ends, and has
not the least notion what it costs to reach them.</p>
<p>For the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon’s
face had a quick angry flush upon it.</p>
<p>“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you
may rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to
the different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the
facile conjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me
to gain a temporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it
is ever the trial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the
impatient scorn of chatterers who attempt only the smallest
achievements, being indeed equipped for no other. And it were well
if all such could be admonished to discriminate judgments of which
the true subject-matter lies entirely beyond their reach, from
those of which the elements may be compassed by a narrow and
superficial survey.”</p>
<p>This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite
unusual with Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an
improvisation, but had taken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed
out like the round grains from a fruit when sudden heat cracks it.
Dorothea was not only his wife: she was a personification of that
shallow world which surrounds the appreciated or desponding
author.</p>
<p>Dorothea was indignant in her turn. Had she not been repressing
everything in herself except the desire to enter into some
fellowship with her husband’s chief interests?</p>
<p>“My judgment <i>was</i> a very superficial one—such as I am
capable of forming," she answered, with a prompt resentment, that
needed no rehearsal. "You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have
often spoken of them—you have often said that they wanted
digesting. But I never heard you speak of the writing that is to be
published. Those were very simple facts, and my judgment went no
farther. I only begged you to let me be of some good to you."</p>
<p>Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply,
taking up a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it. Both
were shocked at their mutual situation—that each should have
betrayed anger towards the other. If they had been at home, settled
at Lowick in ordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would
have been less embarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express
object of which is to isolate two people on the ground that they
are all the world to each other, the sense of disagreement is, to
say the least, confounding and stultifying. To have changed your
longitude extensively and placed yourselves in a moral solitude in
order to have small explosions, to find conversation difficult and
to hand a glass of water without looking, can hardly be regarded as
satisfactory fulfilment even to the toughest minds. To Dorothea’s
inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed like a catastrophe, changing
all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was a new pain, he never
having been on a wedding journey before, or found himself in that
close union which was more of a subjection than he had been able to
imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged him to
much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously given),
but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just where he
most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against the
cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given
it a more substantial presence?</p>
<p>Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To
have reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would
have been a show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience
shrank from, seeing that she already began to feel herself guilty.
However just her indignation might be, her ideal was not to claim
justice, but to give tenderness. So when the carriage came to the
door, she drove with Mr. Casaubon to the Vatican, walked with him
through the stony avenue of inscriptions, and when she parted with
him at the entrance to the Library, went on through the Museum out
of mere listlessness as to what was around her. She had not spirit
to turn round and say that she would drive anywhere. It was when
Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann had first seen her, and
he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at the same time with
her; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with whom he was to
settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical mediaeval-looking
figure there. After they had examined the figure, and had walked on
finishing their dispute, they had parted, Ladislaw lingering behind
while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where he again saw
Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding abstraction which made her
pose remarkable. She did not really see the streak of sunlight on
the floor more than she saw the statues: she was inwardly seeing
the light of years to come in her own home and over the English
fields and elms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the
way in which they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not
so clear to her as it had been. But in Dorothea’s mind there was a
current into which all thought and feeling were apt sooner or later
to flow—the reaching forward of the whole consciousness towards the
fullest truth, the least partial good. There was clearly something
better than anger and despondency.</p>
