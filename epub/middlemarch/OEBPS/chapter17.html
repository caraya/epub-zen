<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next
evening, lived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable
enough to match the church which it looked out upon. All the
furniture too in the house was old, but with another grade of
age—that of Mr. Farebrother's father and grandfather. There were
painted white chairs, with gilding and wreaths on them, and some
lingering red silk damask with slits in it. There were engraved
portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated lawyers of the
last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect them, as
well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling a
prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the
dark wainscot This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into
which Lydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive
him, who were also old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine
respectability: Mrs. Farebrother, the Vicar's white-haired mother,
befrilled and kerchiefed with dainty cleanliness, up right,
quick-eyed, and still under seventy; Miss Noble, her sister, a tiny
old lady of meeker aspect, with frills and kerchief decidedly more
worn and mended; and Miss Winifred Farebrother, the Vicar's elder
sister, well-looking like himself, but nipped and subdued as single
women are apt to be who spend their lives in uninterrupted
subjection to their elders. Lydgate had not expected to see so
quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a bachelor,
he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the chief
furniture would probably be books and collections of natural
objects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect,
as most men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the
first time in their own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of
genial parts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new
piece. This was not the case with Mr. Farebrother: he seemed a
trifle milder and more silent, the chief talker being his mother,
while he only put in a good-humored moderating remark here and
there. The old lady was evidently accustomed to tell her company
what they ought to think, and to regard no subject as quite safe
without her steering. She was afforded leisure for this function by
having all her little wants attended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile
tiny Miss Noble carried on her arm a small basket, into which she
diverted a bit of sugar, which she had first dropped in her saucer
as if by mistake; looking round furtively afterwards, and reverting
to her teacup with a small innocent noise as of a tiny timid
quadruped. Pray think no ill of Miss Noble. That basket held small
savings from her more portable food, destined for the children of
her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine mornings; fostering
and petting all needy creatures being so spontaneous a delight to
her, that she regarded it much as if it had been a pleasant vice
that she was addicted to. Perhaps she was conscious of being
tempted to steal from those who had much that she might give to
those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the guilt of
that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of
giving!</p>
<p>Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and
precision. She presently informed him that they were not often in
want of medical aid in that house. She had brought up her children
to wear flannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit
she considered the chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate
pleaded for those whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten
themselves, but Mrs. Farebrother held that view of things
dangerous: Nature was more just than that; it would be easy for any
felon to say that his ancestors ought to have been hanged instead
of him. If those he had bad fathers and mothers were bad
themselves, they were hanged for that. There was no need to go back
on what you couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“My mother is like old George the Third,” said the Vicar, “she
objects to metaphysics.”</p>
<p>“I object to what is wrong, Camden. I say, keep hold of a few
plain truths, and make everything square with them. When I was
young, Mr. Lydgate, there never was any question about right and
wrong. We knew our catechism, and that was enough; we learned our
creed and our duty. Every respectable Church person had the same
opinions. But now, if you speak out of the Prayer-book itself, you
are liable to be contradicted.”</p>
<p>“That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to
maintain their own point,” said Lydgate.</p>
<p>“But my mother always gives way,” said the Vicar, slyly.</p>
<p>“No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake
about <i>me</i>. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents,
to give up what they taught me. Any one may see what comes of
turning. If you change once, why not twenty times?"</p>
<p>“A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see
them for changing again,” said Lydgate, amused with the decisive
old lady.</p>
<p>“Excuse me there. If you go upon arguments, they are never
wanting, when a man has no constancy of mind. My father never
changed, and he preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and
was a good man—few better. When you get me a good man made out of
arguments, I will get you a good dinner with reading you the
cookery-book. That’s my opinion, and I think anybody’s stomach will
bear me out.”</p>
<p>“About the dinner certainly, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p>“It is the same thing, the dinner or the man. I am nearly
seventy, Mr. Lydgate, and I go upon experience. I am not likely to
follow new lights, though there are plenty of them here as
elsewhere. I say, they came in with the mixed stuffs that will
neither wash nor wear. It was not so in my youth: a Churchman was a
Churchman, and a clergyman, you might be pretty sure, was a
gentleman, if nothing else. But now he may be no better than a
Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on pretence of doctrine.
But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am proud to say, Mr.
Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in this kingdom,
not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to go by; at
least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.”</p>
<p>“A mother is never partial,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.
“What do you think Tyke’s mother says about him?”</p>
<p>“Ah, poor creature! what indeed?” said Mrs. Farebrother, her
sharpness blunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal
judgments. “She says the truth to herself, depend upon it.”</p>
<p>“And what is the truth?” said Lydgate. “I am curious to
know.”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing bad at all,” said Mr. Farebrother. “He is a zealous
fellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think—because I
don’t agree with him.”</p>
<p>“Why, Camden!” said Miss Winifred, “Griffin and his wife told me
only to-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if
they came to hear you preach.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed
after her small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son
as if to say “You hear that?” Miss Noble said, “Oh poor things!
poor things!” in reference, probably, to the double loss of
preaching and coal. But the Vicar answered quietly—</p>
<p>“That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don’t think
my sermons are worth a load of coals to them.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this
pass, “you don’t know my son: he always undervalues himself. I tell
him he is undervaluing the God who made him, and made him a most
excellent preacher.”</p>
<p>“That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my
study, mother,” said the Vicar, laughing. “I promised to show you
my collection,” he added, turning to Lydgate; “shall we go?”</p>
<p>All three ladies remonstrated. Mr. Lydgate ought not to be
hurried away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea:
Miss Winifred had abundance of good tea in the pot. Why was Camden
in such haste to take a visitor to his den? There was nothing but
pickled vermin, and drawers full of blue-bottles and moths, with no
carpet on the floor. Mr. Lydgate must excuse it. A game at cribbage
would be far better. In short, it was plain that a vicar might be
adored by his womankind as the king of men and preachers, and yet
be held by them to stand in much need of their direction. Lydgate,
with the usual shallowness of a young bachelor, wondered that Mr.
Farebrother had not taught them better.</p>
<p>“My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any
interest in my hobbies,” said the Vicar, as he opened the door of
his study, which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the
ladies had implied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box
were to be excepted.</p>
<p>“Men of your profession don’t generally smoke,” he said. Lydgate
smiled and shook his head. “Nor of mine either, properly, I
suppose. You will hear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode
and Company. They don’t know how pleased the devil would be if I
gave it up.”</p>
<p>“I understand. You are of an excitable temper and want a
sedative. I am heavier, and should get idle with it. I should rush
into idleness, and stagnate there with all my might.”</p>
<p>“And you mean to give it all to your work. I am some ten or
twelve years older than you, and have come to a compromise. I feed
a weakness or two lest they should get clamorous. See,” continued
the Vicar, opening several small drawers, “I fancy I have made an
exhaustive study of the entomology of this district. I am going on
both with the fauna and flora; but I have at least done my insects
well. We are singularly rich in orthoptera: I don’t know
whether—Ah! you have got hold of that glass jar—you are looking
into that instead of my drawers. You don’t really care about these
things?”</p>
<p>“Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have
never had time to give myself much to natural history. I was early
bitten with an interest in structure, and it is what lies most
directly in my profession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea
to swim in there.”</p>
<p>“Ah! you are a happy fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, turning on
his heel and beginning to fill his pipe. “You don’t know what it is
to want spiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small
items about a variety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known
signature of Philomicron, for the ’Twaddler’s Magazine;’ or a
learned treatise on the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all
the insects not mentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites
in their passage through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant,
as treated by Solomon, showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs
with the results of modern research. You don’t mind my fumigating
you?”</p>
<p>Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at
its implied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in
the right vocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and
the bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural
History, made him think again of the winnings at cards and their
destination. But he was beginning to wish that the very best
construction of everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the
true one. The Vicar’s frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort
that comes from an uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the
judgment of others, but simply the relief of a desire to do with as
little pretence as possible. Apparently he was not without a sense
that his freedom of speech might seem premature, for he presently
said—</p>
<p>“I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr.
Lydgate, and know you better than you know me. You remember Trawley
who shared your apartment at Paris for some time? I was a
correspondent of his, and he told me a good deal about you. I was
not quite sure when you first came that you were the same man. I
was very glad when I found that you were. Only I don’t forget that
you have not had the like prologue about me.”</p>
<p>Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half
understand it. “By the way,” he said, “what has become of Trawley?
I have quite lost sight of him. He was hot on the French social
systems, and talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of
Pythagorean community. Is he gone?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. He is practising at a German bath, and has married
a rich patient.”</p>
<p>“Then my notions wear the best, so far,” said Lydgate, with a
short scornful laugh. “He would have it, the medical profession was
an inevitable system of humbug. I said, the fault was in the
men—men who truckle to lies and folly. Instead of preaching against
humbug outside the walls, it might be better to set up a
disinfecting apparatus within. In short—I am reporting my own
conversation—you may be sure I had all the good sense on my
side.”</p>
<p>“Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the
Pythagorean community, though. You have not only got the old Adam
in yourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of
the original Adam who form the society around you. You see, I have
paid twelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of
difficulties. But”—Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then
added, “you are eying that glass vase again. Do you want to make an
exchange? You shall not have it without a fair barter.”</p>
<p>“I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits. And I will
throw in Robert Brown’s new thing—’Microscopic Observations on the
Pollen of Plants’—if you don’t happen to have it already.”</p>
<p>“Why, seeing how you long for the monster, I might ask a higher
price. Suppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with
me about all my new species?” The Vicar, while he talked in this
way, alternately moved about with his pipe in his mouth, and
returned to hang rather fondly over his drawers. “That would be
good discipline, you know, for a young doctor who has to please his
patients in Middlemarch. You must learn to be bored, remember.
However, you shall have the monster on your own terms.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think men overrate the necessity for humoring
everybody’s nonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they
humor?” said Lydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother’s side, and looking
rather absently at the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names
subscribed in exquisite writing. “The shortest way is to make your
value felt, so that people must put up with you whether you flatter
them or not.”</p>
<p>“With all my heart. But then you must be sure of having the
value, and you must keep yourself independent. Very few men can do
that. Either you slip out of service altogether, and become good
for nothing, or you wear the harness and draw a good deal where
your yoke-fellows pull you. But do look at these delicate
orthoptera!”</p>
<p>Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the
Vicar laughing at himself, and yet persisting in the
exhibition.</p>
<p>“Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,” Lydgate began,
after they had sat down, “I made up my mind some time ago to do
with as little of it as possible. That was why I determined not to
try anything in London, for a good many years at least. I didn’t
like what I saw when I was studying there—so much empty bigwiggism,
and obstructive trickery. In the country, people have less
pretension to knowledge, and are less of companions, but for that
reason they affect one’s amour-propre less: one makes less bad
blood, and can follow one’s own course more quietly.”</p>
<p>“Yes—well—you have got a good start; you are in the right
profession, the work you feel yourself most fit for. Some people
miss that, and repent too late. But you must not be too sure of
keeping your independence.”</p>
<p>“You mean of family ties?” said Lydgate, conceiving that these
might press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p>“Not altogether. Of course they make many things more difficult.
But a good wife—a good unworldly woman—may really help a man, and
keep him more independent. There’s a parishioner of mine—a fine
fellow, but who would hardly have pulled through as he has done
without his wife. Do you know the Garths? I think they were not
Peacock’s patients.”</p>
<p>“No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone’s, at
Lowick.”</p>
<p>“Their daughter: an excellent girl.”</p>
<p>“She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her.”</p>
<p>“She has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” said Lydgate; he could hardly say “Of
course.“</p>
<p>“Oh, she gauges everybody. I prepared her for confirmation—she
is a favorite of mine.”</p>
<p>Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not
caring to know more about the Garths. At last the Vicar laid down
his pipe, stretched out his legs, and turned his bright eyes with a
smile towards Lydgate, saying—</p>
<p>“But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be. We
have our intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example,
and Bulstrode is another. If you vote for me you will offend
Bulstrode.”</p>
<p>“What is there against Bulstrode?” said Lydgate,
emphatically.</p>
<p>“I did not say there was anything against him except that. If
you vote against him you will make him your enemy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that I need mind about that,” said Lydgate, rather
proudly; “but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he
spends large sums on useful public objects. He might help me a good
deal in carrying out my ideas. As to his religious notions—why, as
Voltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if
administered with a certain quantity of arsenic. I look for the man
who will bring the arsenic, and don’t mind about his
incantations.”</p>
<p>“Very good. But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You
will not offend me, you know,” said Mr. Farebrother, quite
unaffectedly. “I don’t translate my own convenience into other
people’s duties. I am opposed to Bulstrode in many ways. I don’t
like the set he belongs to: they are a narrow ignorant set, and do
more to make their neighbors uncomfortable than to make them
better. Their system is a sort of worldly-spiritual cliqueism: they
really look on the rest of mankind as a doomed carcass which is to
nourish them for heaven. But,” he added, smilingly, “I don’t say
that Bulstrode’s new hospital is a bad thing; and as to his wanting
to oust me from the old one—why, if he thinks me a mischievous
fellow, he is only returning a compliment. And I am not a model
clergyman—only a decent makeshift.”</p>
<p>Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself. A
model clergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own
profession the finest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere
nourishment to his moral pathology and therapeutics. He only said,
“What reason does Bulstrode give for superseding you?”</p>
<p>“That I don’t teach his opinions—which he calls spiritual
religion; and that I have no time to spare. Both statements are
true. But then I could make time, and I should be glad of the forty
pounds. That is the plain fact of the case. But let us dismiss it.
I only wanted to tell you that if you vote for your arsenic-man,
you are not to cut me in consequence. I can’t spare you. You are a
sort of circumnavigator come to settle among us, and will keep up
my belief in the antipodes. Now tell me all about them in
Paris.”</p>
