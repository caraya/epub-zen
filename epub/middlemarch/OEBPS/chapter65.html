<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs
even over the present quickening in the general pace of things:
what wonder then that in 1832 old Sir Godwin Lydgate was slow to
write a letter which was of consequence to others rather than to
himself? Nearly three weeks of the new year were gone, and
Rosamond, awaiting an answer to her winning appeal, was every day
disappointed. Lydgate, in total ignorance of her expectations, was
seeing the bills come in, and feeling that Dover's use of his
advantage over other creditors was imminent. He had never mentioned
to Rosamond his brooding purpose of going to Quallingham: he did
not want to admit what would appear to her a concession to her
wishes after indignant refusal, until the last moment; but he was
really expecting to set off soon. A slice of the railway would
enable him to manage the whole journey and back in four days.</p>
<p>But one morning after Lydgate had gone out, a letter came
addressed to him, which Rosamond saw clearly to be from Sir Godwin.
She was full of hope. Perhaps there might be a particular note to
her enclosed; but Lydgate was naturally addressed on the question
of money or other aid, and the fact that he was written to, nay,
the very delay in writing at all, seemed to certify that the answer
was thoroughly compliant. She was too much excited by these
thoughts to do anything but light stitching in a warm corner of the
dining-room, with the outside of this momentous letter lying on the
table before her. About twelve she heard her husband’s step in the
passage, and tripping to open the door, she said in her lightest
tones, “Tertius, come in here—here is a letter for you.”</p>
<p>“Ah?“ he said, not taking off his hat, but just turning her
round within his arm to walk towards the spot where the letter lay.
”My uncle Godwin!“ he exclaimed, while Rosamond reseated herself,
and watched him as he opened the letter. She had expected him to be
surprised.</p>
<p>While Lydgate’s eyes glanced rapidly over the brief letter, she
saw his face, usually of a pale brown, taking on a dry whiteness;
with nostrils and lips quivering he tossed down the letter before
her, and said violently—</p>
<p>“It will be impossible to endure life with you, if you will
always be acting secretly—acting in opposition to me and hiding
your actions.”</p>
<p>He checked his speech and turned his back on her—then wheeled
round and walked about, sat down, and got up again restlessly,
grasping hard the objects deep down in his pockets. He was afraid
of saying something irremediably cruel.</p>
<p>Rosamond too had changed color as she read. The letter ran in
this way:—</p>
<p class="letter">“DEAR TERTIUS,—Don’t set your wife to write to me
when you have anything to ask. It is a roundabout wheedling sort of
thing which I should not have credited you with. I never choose to
write to a woman on matters of business. As to my supplying you
with a thousand pounds, or only half that sum, I can do nothing of
the sort. My own family drains me to the last penny. With two
younger sons and three daughters, I am not likely to have cash to
spare. You seem to have got through your own money pretty quickly,
and to have made a mess where you are; the sooner you go somewhere
else the better. But I have nothing to do with men of your
profession, and can’t help you there. I did the best I could for
you as guardian, and let you have your own way in taking to
medicine. You might have gone into the army or the Church. Your
money would have held out for that, and there would have been a
surer ladder before you. Your uncle Charles has had a grudge
against you for not going into his profession, but not I. I have
always wished you well, but you must consider yourself on your own
legs entirely now.</p>
<p class="closing">Your affectionate uncle,<br/>
    GODWIN LYDGATE."<br/></p>
<p>When Rosamond had finished reading the letter she sat quite
still, with her hands folded before her, restraining any show of
her keen disappointment, and intrenching herself in quiet passivity
under her husband’s wrath. Lydgate paused in his movements, looked
at her again, and said, with biting severity—</p>
<p>“Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by
secret meddling? Have you sense enough to recognize now your
incompetence to judge and act for me—to interfere with your
ignorance in affairs which it belongs to me to decide on?”</p>
<p>The words were hard; but this was not the first time that
Lydgate had been frustrated by her. She did not look at him, and
made no reply.</p>
<p>“I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham. It would have
cost me pain enough to do it, yet it might have been of some use.
But it has been of no use for me to think of anything. You have
always been counteracting me secretly. You delude me with a false
assent, and then I am at the mercy of your devices. If you mean to
resist every wish I express, say so and defy me. I shall at least
know what I am doing then.”</p>
<p>It is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of
love’s bond has turned to this power of galling. In spite of
Rosamond’s self-control a tear fell silently and rolled over her
lips. She still said nothing; but under that quietude was hidden an
intense effect: she was in such entire disgust with her husband
that she wished she had never seen him. Sir Godwin’s rudeness
towards her and utter want of feeling ranged him with Dover and all
other creditors—disagreeable people who only thought of themselves,
and did not mind how annoying they were to her. Even her father was
unkind, and might have done more for them. In fact there was but
one person in Rosamond’s world whom she did not regard as
blameworthy, and that was the graceful creature with blond plaits
and with little hands crossed before her, who had never expressed
herself unbecomingly, and had always acted for the best—the best
naturally being what she best liked.</p>
<p>Lydgate pausing and looking at her began to feel that
half-maddening sense of helplessness which comes over passionate
people when their passion is met by an innocent-looking silence
whose meek victimized air seems to put them in the wrong, and at
last infects even the justest indignation with a doubt of its
justice. He needed to recover the full sense that he was in the
right by moderating his words.</p>
<p>“Can you not see, Rosamond,” he began again, trying to be simply
grave and not bitter, “that nothing can be so fatal as a want of
openness and confidence between us? It has happened again and again
that I have expressed a decided wish, and you have seemed to
assent, yet after that you have secretly disobeyed my wish. In that
way I can never know what I have to trust to. There would be some
hope for us if you would admit this. Am I such an unreasonable,
furious brute? Why should you not be open with me?” Still
silence.</p>
<p>“Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may
depend on your not acting secretly in future?” said Lydgate,
urgently, but with something of request in his tone which Rosamond
was quick to perceive. She spoke with coolness.</p>
<p>“I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such
words as you have used towards me. I have not been accustomed to
language of that kind. You have spoken of my ’secret meddling,’ and
my ’interfering ignorance,’ and my ’false assent.’ I have never
expressed myself in that way to you, and I think that you ought to
apologize. You spoke of its being impossible to live with me.
Certainly you have not made my life pleasant to me of late. I think
it was to be expected that I should try to avert some of the
hardships which our marriage has brought on me.” Another tear fell
as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she pressed it away as quietly as
the first.</p>
<p>Lydgate flung himself into a chair, feeling checkmated. What
place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in? He laid
down his hat, flung an arm over the back of his chair, and looked
down for some moments without speaking. Rosamond had the double
purchase over him of insensibility to the point of justice in his
reproach, and of sensibility to the undeniable hardships now
present in her married life. Although her duplicity in the affair
of the house had exceeded what he knew, and had really hindered the
Plymdales from knowing of it, she had no consciousness that her
action could rightly be called false. We are not obliged to
identify our own acts according to a strict classification, any
more than the materials of our grocery and clothes. Rosamond felt
that she was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate had to
recognize.</p>
<p>As for him, the need of accommodating himself to her nature,
which was inflexible in proportion to its negations, held him as
with pincers. He had begun to have an alarmed foresight of her
irrevocable loss of love for him, and the consequent dreariness of
their life. The ready fulness of his emotions made this dread
alternate quickly with the first violent movements of his anger. It
would assuredly have been a vain boast in him to say that he was
her master.</p>
<p>“You have not made my life pleasant to me of late”—”the
hardships which our marriage has brought on me“—these words were
stinging his imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream. If
he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into
the hideous fettering of domestic hate?</p>
<p>“Rosamond,“ he said, turning his eyes on her with a melancholy
look, ”you should allow for a man’s words when he is disappointed
and provoked. You and I cannot have opposite interests. I cannot
part my happiness from yours. If I am angry with you, it is that
you seem not to see how any concealment divides us. How could I
wish to make anything hard to you either by my words or conduct?
When I hurt you, I hurt part of my own life. I should never be
angry with you if you would be quite open with me.“</p>
<p>“I have only wished to prevent you from hurrying us into
wretchedness without any necessity,” said Rosamond, the tears
coming again from a softened feeling now that her husband had
softened. “It is so very hard to be disgraced here among all the
people we know, and to live in such a miserable way. I wish I had
died with the baby.”</p>
<p>She spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words
and tears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man. Lydgate drew his
chair near to hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek
with his powerful tender hand. He only caressed her; he did not say
anything; for what was there to say? He could not promise to shield
her from the dreaded wretchedness, for he could see no sure means
of doing so. When he left her to go out again, he told himself that
it was ten times harder for her than for him: he had a life away
from home, and constant appeals to his activity on behalf of
others. He wished to excuse everything in her if he could—but it
was inevitable that in that excusing mood he should think of her as
if she were an animal of another and feebler species. Nevertheless
she had mastered him.</p>
