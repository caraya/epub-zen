<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he triumphant confidence of the Mayor founded on Mr.
Featherstone's insistent demand that Fred and his mother should not
leave him, was a feeble emotion compared with all that was
agitating the breasts of the old man's blood-relations, who
naturally manifested more their sense of the family tie and were
more visibly numerous now that he had become bedridden. Naturally:
for when "poor Peter" had occupied his arm-chair in the wainscoted
parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling
water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had
reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone blood
was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from
poverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family
candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they
were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother
in the solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior
claims of wealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural
enough to banish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric
that he should have kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the
rest, who had no shadow of such claims. They knew Peter's maxim,
that money was a good egg, and should be laid in a warm nest.</p>
<p>But Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and all the needy exiles, held
a different point of view. Probabilities are as various as the
faces to be seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form
is there, from Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative
inclination. To the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that
since Peter had done nothing for them in his life, he would
remember them at the last. Jonah argued that men liked to make a
surprise of their wills, while Martha said that nobody need be
surprised if he left the best part of his money to those who least
expected it. Also it was not to be thought but that an own brother
“lying there” with dropsy in his legs must come to feel that blood
was thicker than water, and if he didn’t alter his will, he might
have money by him. At any rate some blood-relations should be on
the premises and on the watch against those who were hardly
relations at all. Such things had been known as forged wills and
disputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy advantage of
somehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again, those who
were no blood-relations might be caught making away with things—and
poor Peter “lying there” helpless! Somebody should be on the watch.
But in this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and Jane;
also, some nephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still greater
subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to “will away” his
property and give himself large treats of oddity, felt in a
handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be
attended to, and thought of Stone Court as a place which it would
be nothing but right for them to visit. Sister Martha, otherwise
Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in the Chalky Flats, could
not undertake the journey; but her son, as being poor Peter’s own
nephew, could represent her advantageously, and watch lest his
uncle Jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable things
which seemed likely to happen. In fact there was a general sense
running in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch
everybody else, and that it would be well for everybody else to
reflect that the Almighty was watching him.</p>
<p>Thus Stone Court continually saw one or other blood-relation
alighting or departing, and Mary Garth had the unpleasant task of
carrying their messages to Mr. Featherstone, who would see none of
them, and sent her down with the still more unpleasant task of
telling them so. As manager of the household she felt bound to ask
them in good provincial fashion to stay and eat; but she chose to
consult Mrs. Vincy on the point of extra down-stairs consumption
now that Mr. Featherstone was laid up.</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear, you must do things handsomely where there’s last
illness and a property. God knows, I don’t grudge them every ham in
the house—only, save the best for the funeral. Have some stuffed
veal always, and a fine cheese in cut. You must expect to keep open
house in these last illnesses,” said liberal Mrs. Vincy, once more
of cheerful note and bright plumage.</p>
<p>But some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the
handsome treating to veal and ham. Brother Jonah, for example
(there are such unpleasant people in most families; perhaps even in
the highest aristocracy there are Brobdingnag specimens,
gigantically in debt and bloated at greater expense)—Brother Jonah,
I say, having come down in the world, was mainly supported by a
calling which he was modest enough not to boast of, though it was
much better than swindling either on exchange or turf, but which
did not require his presence at Brassing so long as he had a good
corner to sit in and a supply of food. He chose the kitchen-corner,
partly because he liked it best, and partly because he did not want
to sit with Solomon, concerning whom he had a strong brotherly
opinion. Seated in a famous arm-chair and in his best suit,
constantly within sight of good cheer, he had a comfortable
consciousness of being on the premises, mingled with fleeting
suggestions of Sunday and the bar at the Green Man; and he informed
Mary Garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother Peter
while that poor fellow was above ground. The troublesome ones in a
family are usually either the wits or the idiots. Jonah was the wit
among the Featherstones, and joked with the maid-servants when they
came about the hearth, but seemed to consider Miss Garth a
suspicious character, and followed her with cold eyes.</p>
<p>Mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative
ease, but unfortunately there was young Cranch, who, having come
all the way from the Chalky Flats to represent his mother and watch
his uncle Jonah, also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly
in the kitchen to give his uncle company. Young Cranch was not
exactly the balancing point between the wit and the idiot,—verging
slightly towards the latter type, and squinting so as to leave
everything in doubt about his sentiments except that they were not
of a forcible character. When Mary Garth entered the kitchen and
Mr. Jonah Featherstone began to follow her with his cold detective
eyes, young Cranch turning his head in the same direction seemed to
insist on it that she should remark how he was squinting, as if he
did it with design, like the gypsies when Borrow read the New
Testament to them. This was rather too much for poor Mary;
sometimes it made her bilious, sometimes it upset her gravity. One
day that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the
kitchen scene to Fred, who would not be hindered from immediately
going to see it, affecting simply to pass through. But no sooner
did he face the four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest
door which happened to lead to the dairy, and there under the high
roof and among the pans he gave way to laughter which made a hollow
resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen. He fled by another
doorway, but Mr. Jonah, who had not before seen Fred’s white
complexion, long legs, and pinched delicacy of face, prepared many
sarcasms in which these points of appearance were wittily combined
with the lowest moral attributes.</p>
<p>“Why, Tom, <i>you</i> don't wear such gentlemanly trousers—you
haven't got half such fine long legs," said Jonah to his nephew,
winking at the same time, to imply that there was something more in
these statements than their undeniableness. Tom looked at his legs,
but left it uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to
a more vicious length of limb and reprehensible gentility of
trouser.</p>
<p>In the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs
of eyes on the watch, and own relatives eager to be “sitters-up.“
Many came, lunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady
who had been Jane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she was
Mrs. Waule found it good to be there every day for hours, without
other calculable occupation than that of observing the cunning Mary
Garth (who was so deep that she could be found out in nothing) and
giving occasional dry wrinkly indications of crying—as if capable
of torrents in a wetter season—at the thought that they were not
allowed to go into Mr. Featherstone’s room. For the old man’s
dislike of his own family seemed to get stronger as he got less
able to amuse himself by saying biting things to them. Too languid
to sting, he had the more venom refluent in his blood.</p>
<p>Not fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they
had presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom,
both in black—Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially
unfolded in her hand—and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning
purple; while Mrs. Vincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons
flying was actually administering a cordial to their own brother,
and the light-complexioned Fred, his short hair curling as might be
expected in a gambler’s, was lolling at his ease in a large
chair.</p>
<p>Old Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal
figures appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to
strengthen him more successfully than the cordial. He was propped
up on a bed-rest, and always had his gold-headed stick lying by
him. He seized it now and swept it backwards and forwards in as
large an area as he could, apparently to ban these ugly spectres,
crying in a hoarse sort of screech—</p>
<p>“Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Brother. Peter,” Mrs. Waule began—but Solomon put his hand
before her repressingly. He was a large-cheeked man, nearly
seventy, with small furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander
temper but thought himself much deeper than his brother Peter;
indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch
as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he
suspected them of being. Even the invisible powers, he thought,
were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and
there—coming from a man of property, who might have been as impious
as others.</p>
<p>“Brother Peter,” he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official
tone, “It’s nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three
Crofts and the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I’ve got on my
mind—”</p>
<p>“Then he knows more than I want to know,” said Peter, laying
down his stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too,
for he reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in
case of closer fighting, and looked hard at Solomon’s bald
head.</p>
<p>“There’s things you might repent of, Brother, for want of
speaking to me,” said Solomon, not advancing, however. “I could sit
up with you to-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might
take your own time to speak, or let me speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said
Peter.</p>
<p>“But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began
Mrs. Waule, with her usual woolly tone. “And when you lie
speechless you may be tired of having strangers about you, and you
may think of me and my children”—but here her voice broke under the
touching thought which she was attributing to her speechless
brother; the mention of ourselves being naturally affecting.</p>
<p>“No, I shan’t,” said old Featherstone, contradictiously. “I
shan’t think of any of you. I’ve made my will, I tell you, I’ve
made my will.” Here he turned his head towards Mrs. Vincy, and
swallowed some more of his cordial.</p>
<p>“Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by
rights to others,” said Mrs. Waule, turning her narrow eyes in the
same direction.</p>
<p>“Oh, sister,” said Solomon, with ironical softness, “you and me
are not fine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble
and let smart people push themselves before us.”</p>
<p>Fred’s spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.
Featherstone, he said, “Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir,
that you may be alone with your friends?”</p>
<p>“Sit down, I tell you,” said old Featherstone, snappishly. “Stop
where you are. Good-by, Solomon,” he added, trying to wield his
stick again, but failing now that he had reversed the handle.
“Good-by, Mrs. Waule. Don’t you come again.”</p>
<p>“I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,” said Solomon.
“I shall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty
will allow.”</p>
<p>“Yes, in property going out of families,” said Mrs. Waule, in
continuation,—“and where there’s steady young men to carry on. But
I pity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by,
Brother Peter.”</p>
<p>“Remember, I’m the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from
the first, just as you did, and have got land already by the name
of Featherstone,” said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as
one which might be suggested in the watches of the night. “But I
bid you good-by for the present.”</p>
<p>Their exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone
pull his wig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth-widening
grimace, as if he were determined to be deaf and blind.</p>
<p>None the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at
the post of duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an
undertone in which the observation and response were so far apart,
that any one hearing them might have imagined himself listening to
speaking automata, in some doubt whether the ingenious mechanism
would really work, or wind itself up for a long time in order to
stick and be silent. Solomon and Jane would have been sorry to be
quick: what that led to might be seen on the other side of the wall
in the person of Brother Jonah.</p>
<p>But their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by
the presence of other guests from far or near. Now that Peter
Featherstone was up-stairs, his property could be discussed with
all that local enlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural
and Middlemarch neighbors expressed much agreement with the family
and sympathy with their interest against the Vincys, and feminine
visitors were even moved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule,
when they recalled the fact that they themselves had been
disappointed in times past by codicils and marriages for spite on
the part of ungrateful elderly gentlemen, who, it might have been
supposed, had been spared for something better. Such conversation
paused suddenly, like an organ when the bellows are let drop, if
Mary Garth came into the room; and all eyes were turned on her as a
possible legatee, or one who might get access to iron chests.</p>
<p>But the younger men who were relatives or connections of the
family, were disposed to admire her in this problematic light, as a
girl who showed much conduct, and who among all the chances that
were flying might turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence
she had her share of compliments and polite attentions.</p>
<p>Especially from Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, a distinguished bachelor
and auctioneer of those parts, much concerned in the sale of land
and cattle: a public character, indeed, whose name was seen on
widely distributed placards, and who might reasonably be sorry for
those who did not know of him. He was second cousin to Peter
Featherstone, and had been treated by him with more amenity than
any other relative, being useful in matters of business; and in
that programme of his funeral which the old man had himself
dictated, he had been named as a Bearer. There was no odious
cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing more than a sincere sense
of his own merit, which, he was aware, in case of rivalry might
tell against competitors; so that if Peter Featherstone, who so far
as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved like as good a soul as
ever breathed, should have done anything handsome by him, all he
could say was, that he had never fished and fawned, but had advised
him to the best of his experience, which now extended over twenty
years from the time of his apprenticeship at fifteen, and was
likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind. His
admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was
accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in
estimating things at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior
phrases, and never used poor language without immediately
correcting himself—which was fortunate, as he was rather loud, and
given to predominate, standing or walking about frequently, pulling
down his waistcoat with the air of a man who is very much of his
own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with his fore-finger, and
marking each new series in these movements by a busy play with his
large seals. There was occasionally a little fierceness in his
demeanor, but it was directed chiefly against false opinion, of
which there is so much to correct in the world that a man of some
reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried. He felt
that the Featherstone family generally was of limited
understanding, but being a man of the world and a public character,
took everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse
with Mr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that
he had impressed the latter greatly by his leading questions
concerning the Chalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr.
Borthrop Trumbull, being an auctioneer, was bound to know the
nature of everything, he would have smiled and trimmed himself
silently with the sense that he came pretty near that. On the
whole, in an auctioneering way, he was an honorable man, not
ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the celebrated Peel, now
Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail to recognize his
importance.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that
ale, Miss Garth, if you will allow me,” he said, coming into the
parlor at half-past eleven, after having had the exceptional
privilege of seeing old Featherstone, and standing with his back to
the fire between Mrs. Waule and Solomon.</p>
<p>“It’s not necessary for you to go out;—let me ring the
bell.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Mary, “I have an errand.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Trumbull, you’re highly favored,” said Mrs.
Waule.</p>
<p>“What! seeing the old man?” said the auctioneer, playing with
his seals dispassionately. “Ah, you see he has relied on me
considerably.” Here he pressed his lips together, and frowned
meditatively.</p>
<p>“Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?” said
Solomon, in a soft tone of humility, in which he had a sense of
luxurious cunning, he being a rich man and not in need of it.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, anybody may ask,” said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and
good-humored though cutting sarcasm. “Anybody may interrogate. Any
one may give their remarks an interrogative turn,” he continued,
his sonorousness rising with his style. “This is constantly done by
good speakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we
call a figure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.”
The eloquent auctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr.
Trumbull,” said Solomon. “I never was against the deserving. It’s
the undeserving I’m against.”</p>
<p>“Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull,
significantly. “It can’t be denied that undeserving people have
been legatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with
testamentary dispositions.” Again he pursed up his lips and frowned
a little.</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother
has left his land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom,
as an unhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing
effect.</p>
<p>“A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as
leave it to some people,” observed Solomon, his sister’s question
having drawn no answer.</p>
<p>“What, Blue-Coat land?” said Mrs. Waule, again. “Oh, Mr.
Trumbull, you never can mean to say that. It would be flying in the
face of the Almighty that’s prospered him.”</p>
<p>While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away
from the fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his
fore-finger round the inside of his stock, then along his whiskers
and the curves of his hair. He now walked to Miss Garth’s
work-table, opened a book which lay there and read the title aloud
with pompous emphasis as if he were offering it for sale:</p>
<p>“’Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ’Maiden of
the Mist, by the author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he
began sonorously—“The course of four centuries has well-nigh
elapsed since the series of events which are related in the
following chapters took place on the Continent.” He pronounced the
last truly admirable word with the accent on the last syllable, not
as unaware of vulgar usage, but feeling that this novel delivery
enhanced the sonorous beauty which his reading had given to the
whole.</p>
<p>And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments
for answering Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she
and Solomon, watching Mr. Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that
high learning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop
Trumbull really knew nothing about old Featherstone’s will; but he
could hardly have been brought to declare any ignorance unless he
had been arrested for misprision of treason.</p>
<p>“I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he
said, reassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack
when I can. I will back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some
morsels with alarming haste, “against any ham in the three
kingdoms. In my opinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt
Hall—and I think I am a tolerable judge.”</p>
<p>“Some don’t like so much sugar in their hams,” said Mrs. Waule.
“But my poor brother would always have sugar.”</p>
<p>“If any person demands better, he is at liberty to do so; but,
God bless me, what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that
quality, I know. There is some gratification to a gentleman”—here
Mr. Trumbull’s voice conveyed an emotional remonstrance—“in having
this kind of ham set on his table.”</p>
<p>He pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew
his chair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at
the inner side of his legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr.
Trumbull having all those less frivolous airs and gestures which
distinguish the predominant races of the north.</p>
<p>“You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he
observed, when Mary re-entered. “It is by the author of ’Waverley’:
that is Sir Walter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself—a
very nice thing, a very superior publication, entitled ’Ivanhoe.’
You will not get any writer to beat him in a hurry, I think—he will
not, in my opinion, be speedily surpassed. I have just been reading
a portion at the commencement of ’Anne of Jeersteen.’ It commences
well.” (Things never began with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always
commenced, both in private life and on his handbills.) “You are a
reader, I see. Do you subscribe to our Middlemarch library?”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Mary. ”Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.“</p>
<p>“I am a great bookman myself,” returned Mr. Trumbull. “I have no
less than two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they
are well selected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers,
Titian, Vandyck, and others. I shall be happy to lend you any work
you like to mention, Miss Garth.”</p>
<p>“I am much obliged,” said Mary, hastening away again, “but I
have little time for reading.”</p>
<p>“I should say my brother has done something for <i>her</i> in
his will," said Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she had
shut the door behind her, pointing with his head towards the absent
Mary.</p>
<p>“His first wife was a poor match for him, though,” said Mrs.
Waule. “She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her
niece,—and very proud. And my brother has always paid her
wage.”</p>
<p>“A sensible girl though, in my opinion,” said Mr. Trumbull,
finishing his ale and starting up with an emphatic adjustment of
his waistcoat. “I have observed her when she has been mixing
medicine in drops. She minds what she is doing, sir. That is a
great point in a woman, and a great point for our friend up-stairs,
poor dear old soul. A man whose life is of any value should think
of his wife as a nurse: that is what I should do, if I married; and
I believe I have lived single long enough not to make a mistake in
that line. Some men must marry to elevate themselves a little, but
when I am in need of that, I hope some one will tell me so—I hope
some individual will apprise me of the fact. I wish you good
morning, Mrs. Waule. Good morning, Mr. Solomon. I trust we shall
meet under less melancholy auspices.”</p>
<p>When Mr. Trumbull had departed with a fine bow, Solomon, leaning
forward, observed to his sister, “You may depend, Jane, my brother
has left that girl a lumping sum.”</p>
<p>“Anybody would think so, from the way Mr. Trumbull talks,” said
Jane. Then, after a pause, “He talks as if my daughters wasn’t to
be trusted to give drops.”</p>
<p>“Auctioneers talk wild,” said Solomon. “Not but what Trumbull
has made money.”</p>
