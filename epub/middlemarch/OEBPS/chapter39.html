<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">S</span>ir James Chettam's mind was not fruitful in devices, but his
growing anxiety to "act on Brooke," once brought close to his
constant belief in Dorothea's capacity for influence, became
formative, and issued in a little plan; namely, to plead Celia's
indisposition as a reason for fetching Dorothea by herself to the
Hall, and to leave her at the Grange with the carriage on the way,
after making her fully aware of the situation concerning the
management of the estate.</p>
<p>In this way it happened that one day near four o’clock, when Mr.
Brooke and Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and
Mrs. Casaubon was announced.</p>
<p>Will, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom,
and, obliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging “documents“ about
hanging sheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have
of riding several horses at once by inwardly arranging measures
towards getting a lodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting
short his constant residence at the Grange; while there flitted
through all these steadier images a tickling vision of a
sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric particularity. When Mrs.
Casaubon was announced he started up as from an electric shock, and
felt a tingling at his finger-ends. Any one observing him would
have seen a change in his complexion, in the adjustment of his
facial muscles, in the vividness of his glance, which might have
made them imagine that every molecule in his body had passed the
message of a magic touch. And so it had. For effective magic is
transcendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those
touches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make
a man’s passion for one woman differ from his passion for another
as joy in the morning light over valley and river and white
mountain-top differs from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass
panels? Will, too, was made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a
violin drawn near him cleverly, would at one stroke change the
aspect of the world for him, and his point of view shifted—as
easily as his mood. Dorothea’s entrance was the freshness of
morning.</p>
<p>“Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,” said Mr. Brooke, meeting
and kissing her. “You have left Casaubon with his books, I suppose.
That’s right. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman,
you know.”</p>
<p>“There is no fear of that, uncle,” said Dorothea, turning to
Will and shaking hands with open cheerfulness, while she made no
other form of greeting, but went on answering her uncle. “I am very
slow. When I want to be busy with books, I am often playing truant
among my thoughts. I find it is not so easy to be learned as to
plan cottages.”</p>
<p>She seated herself beside her uncle opposite to Will, and was
evidently preoccupied with something that made her almost unmindful
of him. He was ridiculously disappointed, as if he had imagined
that her coming had anything to do with him.</p>
<p>“Why, yes, my dear, it was quite your hobby to draw plans. But
it was good to break that off a little. Hobbies are apt to ran away
with us, you know; it doesn’t do to be run away with. We must keep
the reins. I have never let myself be run away with; I always
pulled up. That is what I tell Ladislaw. He and I are alike, you
know: he likes to go into everything. We are working at capital
punishment. We shall do a great deal together, Ladislaw and I.”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Dorothea, with characteristic directness, ”Sir James
has been telling me that he is in hope of seeing a great change
made soon in your management of the estate—that you are thinking of
having the farms valued, and repairs made, and the cottages
improved, so that Tipton may look quite another place. Oh, how
happy!“—she went on, clasping her hands, with a return to that more
childlike impetuous manner, which had been subdued since her
marriage. ”If I were at home still, I should take to riding again,
that I might go about with you and see all that! And you are going
to engage Mr. Garth, who praised my cottages, Sir James says.“</p>
<p>“Chettam is a little hasty, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, coloring
slightly; “a little hasty, you know. I never said I should do
anything of the kind. I never said I should <i>not</i> do it, you
know."</p>
<p>“He only feels confident that you will do it,” said Dorothea, in
a voice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister
chanting a credo, “because you mean to enter Parliament as a member
who cares for the improvement of the people, and one of the first
things to be made better is the state of the land and the laborers.
Think of Kit Downes, uncle, who lives with his wife and seven
children in a house with one sitting room and one bedroom hardly
larger than this table!—and those poor Dagleys, in their
tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the back kitchen and
leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason why I did not
like the pictures here, dear uncle—which you think me stupid about.
I used to come from the village with all that dirt and coarse
ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in the
drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in
what is false, while we don’t mind how hard the truth is for the
neighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come
forward and urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to
alter the evils which lie under our own hands.”</p>
<p>Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten
everything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings,
unchecked: an experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever
present since her marriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of
energy with fear. For the moment, Will’s admiration was accompanied
with a chilling sense of remoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of
feeling that he cannot love a woman so well when he sees a certain
greatness in her: nature having intended greatness for men. But
nature has sometimes made sad oversights in carrying out her
intention; as in the case of good Mr. Brooke, whose masculine
consciousness was at this moment in rather a stammering condition
under the eloquence of his niece. He could not immediately find any
other mode of expressing himself than that of rising, fixing his
eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him. At last he
said—</p>
<p>“There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what
you say—but not everything—eh, Ladislaw? You and I don’t like our
pictures and statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a
little ardent, you know—a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art,
poetry, that kind of thing, elevates a nation—emollit mores—you
understand a little Latin now. But—eh? what?”</p>
<p>These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come
in to say that the keeper had found one of Dagley’s boys with a
leveret in his hand just killed.</p>
<p>“I’ll come, I’ll come. I shall let him off easily, you know,”
said Mr. Brooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very
cheerfully.</p>
<p>“I hope you feel how right this change is that I—that Sir James
wishes for,” said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her uncle was
gone.</p>
<p>“I do, now I have heard you speak about it. I shall not forget
what you have said. But can you think of something else at this
moment? I may not have another opportunity of speaking to you about
what has occurred,” said Will, rising with a movement of
impatience, and holding the back of his chair with both hands.</p>
<p>“Pray tell me what it is,” said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising
and going to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting
and wagging his tail. She leaned her back against the window-frame,
and laid her hand on the dog’s head; for though, as we know, she
was not fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on,
she was always attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite
if she had to decline their advances.</p>
<p>Will followed her only with his eyes and said, “I presume you
know that Mr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his house.”</p>
<p>“No, I did not,” said Dorothea, after a moment’s pause. She was
evidently much moved. “I am very, very sorry,” she added,
mournfully. She was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the
conversation between her and her husband in the darkness; and she
was anew smitten with hopelessness that she could influence Mr.
Casaubon’s action. But the marked expression of her sorrow
convinced Will that it was not all given to him personally, and
that Dorothea had not been visited by the idea that Mr. Casaubon’s
dislike and jealousy of him turned upon herself. He felt an odd
mixture of delight and vexation: of delight that he could dwell and
be cherished in her thought as in a pure home, without suspicion
and without stint—of vexation because he was of too little account
with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an
unhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread
of any change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent, and he
began to speak again in a tone of mere explanation.</p>
<p>“Mr. Casaubon’s reason is, his displeasure at my taking a
position here which he considers unsuited to my rank as his cousin.
I have told him that I cannot give way on this point. It is a
little too hard on me to expect that my course in life is to be
hampered by prejudices which I think ridiculous. Obligation may be
stretched till it is no better than a brand of slavery stamped on
us when we were too young to know its meaning. I would not have
accepted the position if I had not meant to make it useful and
honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity in any other
light.”</p>
<p>Dorothea felt wretched. She thought her husband altogether in
the wrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.</p>
<p>“It is better for us not to speak on the subject,” she said,
with a tremulousness not common in her voice, “since you and Mr.
Casaubon disagree. You intend to remain?” She was looking out on
the lawn, with melancholy meditation.</p>
<p>“Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,” said Will, in a tone
of almost boyish complaint.</p>
<p>“No,“ said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, ”hardly
ever. But I shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for
my uncle.“</p>
<p>“I shall know hardly anything about you,” said Will. “No one
will tell me anything.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my life is very simple,” said Dorothea, her lips curling
with an exquisite smile, which irradiated her melancholy. “I am
always at Lowick.”</p>
<p>“That is a dreadful imprisonment,” said Will, impetuously.</p>
<p>“No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea. “I have no longings.”</p>
<p>He did not speak, but she replied to some change in his
expression. “I mean, for myself. Except that I should like not to
have so much more than my share without doing anything for others.
But I have a belief of my own, and it comforts me.”</p>
<p>“What is that?” said Will, rather jealous of the belief.</p>
<p>“That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t
quite know what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of
the divine power against evil—widening the skirts of light and
making the struggle with darkness narrower.”</p>
<p>“That is a beautiful mysticism—it is a—”</p>
<p>“Please not to call it by any name,” said Dorothea, putting out
her hands entreatingly. “You will say it is Persian, or something
else geographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot
part with it. I have always been finding out my religion since I
was a little girl. I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever pray. I
try not to have desires merely for myself, because they may not be
good for others, and I have too much already. I only told you, that
you might know quite well how my days go at Lowick.”</p>
<p>“God bless you for telling me!” said Will, ardently, and rather
wondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond
children who were talking confidentially of birds.</p>
<p>“What is <i>your</i> religion?" said Dorothea. "I mean—not what
you know about religion, but the belief that helps you most?"</p>
<p>“To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will.
“But I am a rebel: I don’t feel bound, as you do, to submit to what
I don’t like.”</p>
<p>“But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,”
said Dorothea, smiling.</p>
<p>“Now you are subtle,” said Will.</p>
<p>“Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as
if I were subtle,” said Dorothea, playfully. “But how long my uncle
is! I must go and look for him. I must really go on to the Hall.
Celia is expecting me.”</p>
<p>Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said
that he would step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as
Dagley’s, to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught
with the leveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as
they drove along, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the
talk under his own control.</p>
<p>“Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear;
but I should not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and
he can’t say that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you
know. It’s a little against my feeling:—poaching, now, if you come
to look into it—I have often thought of getting up the subject. Not
long ago, Flavell, the Methodist preacher, was brought up for
knocking down a hare that came across his path when he and his wife
were walking out together. He was pretty quick, and knocked it on
the neck.”</p>
<p>“That was very brutal, I think,” said Dorothea</p>
<p>“Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a
Methodist preacher, you know. And Johnson said, ’You may judge what
a <i>hypocrite</i> he is.' And upon my word, I thought Flavell
looked very little like 'the highest style of man'—as somebody
calls the Christian—Young, the poet Young, I think—you know Young?
Well, now, Flavell in his shabby black gaiters, pleading that he
thought the Lord had sent him and his wife a good dinner, and he
had a right to knock it down, though not a mighty hunter before the
Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you it was rather comic: Fielding
would have made something of it—or Scott, now—Scott might have
worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I couldn't
help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say grace
over. It's all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on its
side, you know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However,
it doesn't do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got
Johnson to be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether
Chettam would not have been more severe, and yet he comes down on
me as if I were the hardest man in the county. But here we are at
Dagley's."</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on.
It is wonderful how much uglier things will look when we only
suspect that we are blamed for them. Even our own persons in the
glass are apt to change their aspect for us after we have heard
some frank remark on their less admirable points; and on the other
hand it is astonishing how pleasantly conscience takes our
encroachments on those who never complain or have nobody to
complain for them. Dagley’s homestead never before looked so dismal
to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind thus sore about the
fault-finding of the “Trumpet,“ echoed by Sir James.</p>
<p>It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of
the fine arts which makes other people’s hardships picturesque,
might have been delighted with this homestead called Freeman’s End:
the old house had dormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the
chimneys were choked with ivy, the large porch was blocked up with
bundles of sticks, and half the windows were closed with gray
worm-eaten shutters about which the jasmine-boughs grew in wild
luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall with hollyhocks peeping over
it was a perfect study of highly mingled subdued color, and there
was an aged goat (kept doubtless on interesting superstitious
grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen door. The mossy thatch
of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the pauper laborers in
ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a wagon of corn
into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy of cows
being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in
brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander
about the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding
on a too meagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the
quiet light of a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a
sort of picture which we have all paused over as a “charming bit,”
touching other sensibilities than those which are stirred by the
depression of the agricultural interest, with the sad lack of
farming capital, as seen constantly in the newspapers of that time.
But these troublesome associations were just now strongly present
to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled the scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself
made a figure in the landscape, carrying a pitchfork and wearing
his milking-hat—a very old beaver flattened in front. His coat and
breeches were the best he had, and he would not have been wearing
them on this weekday occasion if he had not been to market and
returned later than usual, having given himself the rare treat of
dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came to fall
into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to
himself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of
the country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were
cut, the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on
the walls, had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a
maxim about Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good
meat should have good drink, which last Dagley interpreted as
plenty of table ale well followed up by rum-and-water. These
liquors have so far truth in them that they were not false enough
to make poor Dagley seem merry: they only made his discontent less
tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken too much in the shape of
muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously disturbing to his
farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that whatever is,
is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was flushed, and
his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood still
grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his easy
shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other
swinging round a thin walking-stick.</p>
<p>“Dagley, my good fellow,” began Mr. Brooke, conscious that he
was going to be very friendly about the boy.</p>
<p>“Oh, ay, I’m a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said
Dagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog
stir from his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the
yard after some outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an
attitude of observation. “I’m glad to hear I’m a good feller.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his worthy
tenant had probably been dining, but saw no reason why he should
not go on, since he could take the precaution of repeating what he
had to say to Mrs. Dagley.</p>
<p>“Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret,
Dagley: I have told Johnson to lock him up in the empty stable an
hour or two, just to frighten him, you know. But he will be brought
home by-and-by, before night: and you’ll just look after him, will
you, and give him a reprimand, you know?”</p>
<p>“No, I woon’t: I’ll be dee’d if I’ll leather my boy to please
you or anybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o’ one,
and that a bad un.”</p>
<p>Dagley’s words were loud enough to summon his wife to the
back-kitchen door—the only entrance ever used, and one always open
except in bad weather—and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, “Well,
well, I’ll speak to your wife—I didn’t mean beating, you know,”
turned to walk to the house. But Dagley, only the more inclined to
“have his say” with a gentleman who walked away from him, followed
at once, with Fag slouching at his heels and sullenly evading some
small and probably charitable advances on the part of Monk.</p>
<p>“How do you do, Mrs. Dagley?” said Mr. Brooke, making some
haste. “I came to tell you about your boy: I don’t want you to give
him the stick, you know.” He was careful to speak quite plainly
this time.</p>
<p>Overworked Mrs. Dagley—a thin, worn woman, from whose life
pleasure had so entirely vanished that she had not even any Sunday
clothes which could give her satisfaction in preparing for
church—had already had a misunderstanding with her husband since he
had come home, and was in low spirits, expecting the worst. But her
husband was beforehand in answering.</p>
<p>“No, nor he woon’t hev the stick, whether you want it or no,”
pursued Dagley, throwing out his voice, as if he wanted it to hit
hard. “You’ve got no call to come an’ talk about sticks o’ these
primises, as you woon’t give a stick tow’rt mending. Go to
Middlemarch to ax for <i>your</i> charrickter."</p>
<p>“You’d far better hold your tongue, Dagley,” said the wife, “and
not kick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family
has been an’ spent money at market and made himself the worse for
liquor, he’s done enough mischief for one day. But I should like to
know what my boy’s done, sir.”</p>
<p>“Niver do you mind what he’s done,” said Dagley, more fiercely,
“it’s my business to speak, an’ not yourn. An’ I wull speak, too.
I’ll hev my say—supper or no. An’ what I say is, as I’ve lived upo’
your ground from my father and grandfather afore me, an’ hev
dropped our money into’t, an’ me an’ my children might lie an’ rot
on the ground for top-dressin’ as we can’t find the money to buy,
if the King wasn’t to put a stop.”</p>
<p>“My good fellow, you’re drunk, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,
confidentially but not judiciously. “Another day, another day,” he
added, turning as if to go.</p>
<p>But Dagley immediately fronted him, and Fag at his heels growled
low, as his master’s voice grew louder and more insulting, while
Monk also drew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the
wagon were pausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite
passive than to attempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling
man.</p>
<p>“I’m no more drunk nor you are, nor so much,” said Dagley. “I
can carry my liquor, an’ I know what I meean. An’ I meean as the
King ’ull put a stop to ’t, for them say it as knows it, as there’s
to be a Rinform, and them landlords as never done the right thing
by their tenants ’ull be treated i’ that way as they’ll hev to
scuttle off. An’ there’s them i’ Middlemarch knows what the Rinform
is—an’ as knows who’ll hev to scuttle. Says they, ’I know who
<i>your</i> landlord is.' An' says I, 'I hope you're the better for
knowin' him, I arn't.' Says they, 'He's a close-fisted un.' 'Ay
ay,' says I. 'He's a man for the Rinform,' says they. That's what
they says. An' I made out what the Rinform were—an' it were to send
you an' your likes a-scuttlin' an' wi' pretty strong-smellin'
things too. An' you may do as you like now, for I'm none afeard on
you. An' you'd better let my boy aloan, an' look to yoursen, afore
the Rinform has got upo' your back. That's what I'n got to say,"
concluded Mr. Dagley, striking his fork into the ground with a
firmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up
again.</p>
<p>At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a
moment for Mr. Brooke to escape. He walked out of the yard as
quickly as he could, in some amazement at the novelty of his
situation. He had never been insulted on his own land before, and
had been inclined to regard himself as a general favorite (we are
all apt to do so, when we think of our own amiability more than of
what other people are likely to want of us). When he had quarrelled
with Caleb Garth twelve years before he had thought that the
tenants would be pleased at the landlord’s taking everything into
his own hands.</p>
<p>Some who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at
the midnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in
those times than for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be
ignorant, in spite somehow of having a rector in the twin parish
who was a gentleman to the backbone, a curate nearer at hand who
preached more learnedly than the rector, a landlord who had gone
into everything, especially fine art and social improvement, and
all the lights of Middlemarch only three miles off. As to the
facility with which mortals escape knowledge, try an average
acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of London, and consider what
that eligible person for a dinner-party would have been if he had
learned scant skill in “summing“ from the parish-clerk of Tipton,
and read a chapter in the Bible with immense difficulty, because
such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained unmanageable after twice
spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses sometimes on a Sunday
evening, and the world was at least not darker to him than it had
been before. Some things he knew thoroughly, namely, the slovenly
habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock and crops,
at Freeman’s End—so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to imply
that a man was free to quit it if he chose, but that there was no
earthly ”beyond” open to him.</p>
