<blockquote><p>“Then went the jury out whose names were Mr.
Blindman, Mr. No-good, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose,
Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind, Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr.
Hate-light, Mr. Implacable, who every one gave in his private
verdict against him among themselves, and afterwards unanimously
concluded to bring him in guilty before the judge. And first among
themselves, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said, I see clearly that
this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away with such a
fellow from the earth! Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the very
look of him. Then said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure him. Nor
I, said Mr. Live-loose; for he would be always condemning my way.
Hang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr.
High-mind. My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a
rogue, said Mr. Liar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr.
Cruelty. Let us despatch him out of the way said Mr. Hate-light.
Then said Mr. Implacable, Might I have all the world given me, I
could not be reconciled to him; therefore let us forthwith bring
him in guilty of death.”—Pilgrim’s Progress.

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen immortal Bunyan makes his picture of the persecuting
passions bringing in their verdict of guilty, who pities Faithful?
That is a rare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not
attained, to know ourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd—to
be sure that what we are denounced for is solely the good in us.
The pitiable lot is that of the man who could not call himself a
martyr even though he were to persuade himself that the men who
stoned him were but ugly passions incarnate—who knows that he is
stoned, not for professing the Right, but for not being the man he
professed to be.</p>
<p>This was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under
while he made his preparations for departing from Middlemarch, and
going to end his stricken life in that sad refuge, the indifference
of new faces. The duteous merciful constancy of his wife had
delivered him from one dread, but it could not hinder her presence
from being still a tribunal before which he shrank from confession
and desired advocacy. His equivocations with himself about the
death of Raffles had sustained the conception of an Omniscience
whom he prayed to, yet he had a terror upon him which would not let
him expose them to judgment by a full confession to his wife: the
acts which he had washed and diluted with inward argument and
motive, and for which it seemed comparatively easy to win invisible
pardon—what name would she call them by? That she should ever
silently call his acts Murder was what he could not bear. He felt
shrouded by her doubt: he got strength to face her from the sense
that she could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst
condemnation on him. Some time, perhaps—when he was dying—he would
tell her all: in the deep shadow of that time, when she held his
hand in the gathering darkness, she might listen without recoiling
from his touch. Perhaps: but concealment had been the habit of his
life, and the impulse to confession had no power against the dread
of a deeper humiliation.</p>
<p>He was full of timid care for his wife, not only because he
deprecated any harshness of judgment from her, but because he felt
a deep distress at the sight of her suffering. She had sent her
daughters away to board at a school on the coast, that this crisis
might be hidden from them as far as possible. Set free by their
absence from the intolerable necessity of accounting for her grief
or of beholding their frightened wonder, she could live
unconstrainedly with the sorrow that was every day streaking her
hair with whiteness and making her eyelids languid.</p>
<p>“Tell me anything that you would like to have me do, Harriet,”
Bulstrode had said to her; “I mean with regard to arrangements of
property. It is my intention not to sell the land I possess in this
neighborhood, but to leave it to you as a safe provision. If you
have any wish on such subjects, do not conceal it from me.”</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, when she had returned from a visit to her
brother’s, she began to speak to her husband on a subject which had
for some time been in her mind.</p>
<p>“I <i>should</i> like to do something for my brother's family,
Nicholas; and I think we are bound to make some amends to Rosamond
and her husband. Walter says Mr. Lydgate must leave the town, and
his practice is almost good for nothing, and they have very little
left to settle anywhere with. I would rather do without something
for ourselves, to make some amends to my poor brother's
family."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in
the phrase “make some amends;” knowing that her husband must
understand her. He had a particular reason, which she was not aware
of, for wincing under her suggestion. He hesitated before he
said—</p>
<p>“It is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you
propose, my dear. Mr. Lydgate has virtually rejected any further
service from me. He has returned the thousand pounds which I lent
him. Mrs. Casaubon advanced him the sum for that purpose. Here is
his letter.”</p>
<p>The letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely. The mention of
Mrs. Casaubon’s loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling
which held it a matter of course that every one would avoid a
connection with her husband. She was silent for some time; and the
tears fell one after the other, her chin trembling as she wiped
them away. Bulstrode, sitting opposite to her, ached at the sight
of that grief-worn face, which two months before had been bright
and blooming. It had aged to keep sad company with his own withered
features. Urged into some effort at comforting her, he said—</p>
<p>“There is another means, Harriet, by which I might do a service
to your brother’s family, if you like to act in it. And it would, I
think, be beneficial to you: it would be an advantageous way of
managing the land which I mean to be yours.”</p>
<p>She looked attentive.</p>
<p>“Garth once thought of undertaking the management of Stone Court
in order to place your nephew Fred there. The stock was to remain
as it is, and they were to pay a certain share of the profits
instead of an ordinary rent. That would be a desirable beginning
for the young man, in conjunction with his employment under Garth.
Would it be a satisfaction to you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it would,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, with some return of
energy. “Poor Walter is so cast down; I would try anything in my
power to do him some good before I go away. We have always been
brother and sister.”</p>
<p>“You must make the proposal to Garth yourself, Harriet,” said
Mr. Bulstrode, not liking what he had to say, but desiring the end
he had in view, for other reasons besides the consolation of his
wife. “You must state to him that the land is virtually yours, and
that he need have no transactions with me. Communications can be
made through Standish. I mention this, because Garth gave up being
my agent. I can put into your hands a paper which he himself drew
up, stating conditions; and you can propose his renewed acceptance
of them. I think it is not unlikely that he will accept when you
propose the thing for the sake of your nephew.”</p>
