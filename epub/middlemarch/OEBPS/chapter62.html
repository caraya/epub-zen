<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>ill Ladislaw's mind was now wholly bent on seeing Dorothea
again, and forthwith quitting Middlemarch. The morning after his
agitating scene with Bulstrode he wrote a brief letter to her,
saying that various causes had detained him in the neighborhood
longer than he had expected, and asking her permission to call
again at Lowick at some hour which she would mention on the
earliest possible day, he being anxious to depart, but unwilling to
do so until she had granted him an interview. He left the letter at
the office, ordering the messenger to carry it to Lowick Manor, and
wait for an answer.</p>
<p>Ladislaw felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words. His
former farewell had been made in the hearing of Sir James Chettam,
and had been announced as final even to the butler. It is certainly
trying to a man’s dignity to reappear when he is not expected to do
so: a first farewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a
second lends an opening to comedy, and it was possible even that
there might be bitter sneers afloat about Will’s motives for
lingering. Still it was on the whole more satisfactory to his
feeling to take the directest means of seeing Dorothea, than to use
any device which might give an air of chance to a meeting of which
he wished her to understand that it was what he earnestly sought.
When he had parted from her before, he had been in ignorance of
facts which gave a new aspect to the relation between them, and
made a more absolute severance than he had then believed in. He
knew nothing of Dorothea’s private fortune, and being little used
to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that according to
Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to him, Will Ladislaw, would
mean that she consented to be penniless. That was not what he could
wish for even in his secret heart, or even if she had been ready to
meet such hard contrast for his sake. And then, too, there was the
fresh smart of that disclosure about his mother’s family, which if
known would be an added reason why Dorothea’s friends should look
down upon him as utterly below her. The secret hope that after some
years he might come back with the sense that he had at least a
personal value equal to her wealth, seemed now the dreamy
continuation of a dream. This change would surely justify him in
asking Dorothea to receive him once more.</p>
<p>But Dorothea on that morning was not at home to receive Will’s
note. In consequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his
intention to be at home in a week, she had driven first to Freshitt
to carry the news, meaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some
orders with which her uncle had intrusted her—thinking, as he said,
“a little mental occupation of this sort good for a widow.”</p>
<p>If Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at
Freshitt that morning, he would have felt all his suppositions
confirmed as to the readiness of certain people to sneer at his
lingering in the neighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much
relieved concerning Dorothea, had been on the watch to learn
Ladislaw’s movements, and had an instructed informant in Mr.
Standish, who was necessarily in his confidence on this matter.
That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch nearly two months after he
had declared that he was going immediately, was a fact to embitter
Sir James’s suspicions, or at least to justify his aversion to a
“young fellow” whom he represented to himself as slight, volatile,
and likely enough to show such recklessness as naturally went along
with a position unriveted by family ties or a strict profession.
But he had just heard something from Standish which, while it
justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of nullifying
all danger with regard to Dorothea.</p>
<p>Unwonted circumstances may make us all rather unlike ourselves:
there are conditions under which the most majestic person is
obliged to sneeze, and our emotions are liable to be acted on in
the same incongruous manner. Good Sir James was this morning so far
unlike himself that he was irritably anxious to say something to
Dorothea on a subject which he usually avoided as if it had been a
matter of shame to them both. He could not use Celia as a medium,
because he did not choose that she should know the kind of gossip
he had in his mind; and before Dorothea happened to arrive he had
been trying to imagine how, with his shyness and unready tongue, he
could ever manage to introduce his communication. Her unexpected
presence brought him to utter hopelessness in his own power of
saying anything unpleasant; but desperation suggested a resource;
he sent the groom on an unsaddled horse across the park with a
pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who already knew the gossip,
and would think it no compromise of herself to repeat it as often
as required.</p>
<p>Dorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom
she wanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and
she was still talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the
watch for the rector’s wife, saw her coming and met her with the
needful hints.</p>
<p>“Enough! I understand,”—said Mrs. Cadwallader. “You shall be
innocent. I am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean that it’s of any consequence,” said Sir James,
disliking that Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. “Only
it is desirable that Dorothea should know there are reasons why she
should not receive him again; and I really can’t say so to her. It
will come lightly from you.”</p>
<p>It came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and
turned to meet them, it appeared that Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped
across the park by the merest chance in the world, just to chat
with Celia in a matronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was
coming back? Delightful!—coming back, it was to be hoped, quite
cured of Parliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the
“Pioneer“—somebody had prophesied that it would soon be like a
dying dolphin, and turn all colors for want of knowing how to help
itself, because Mr. Brooke’s protege, the brilliant young Ladislaw,
was gone or going. Had Sir James heard that?</p>
<p>The three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James,
turning aside to whip a shrub, said he had heard something of that
sort.</p>
<p>“All false!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “He is not gone, or going,
apparently; the ’Pioneer’ keeps its color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw
is making a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your
Mr. Lydgate’s wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be.
It seems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young
gentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people
in manufacturing towns are always disreputable.”</p>
<p>“You began by saying that one report was false, Mrs.
Cadwallader, and I believe this is false too,” said Dorothea, with
indignant energy; “at least, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation.
I will not hear any evil spoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already
suffered too much injustice.”</p>
<p>Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought
of her feelings; and even if she had been able to reflect, she
would have held it petty to keep silence at injurious words about
Will from fear of being herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed
and her lip trembled.</p>
<p>Sir James, glancing at her, repented of his stratagem; but Mrs.
Cadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of her hands
outward and said—“Heaven grant it, my dear!—I mean that all bad
tales about anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young
Lydgate should have married one of these Middlemarch girls.
Considering he’s a son of somebody, he might have got a woman with
good blood in her veins, and not too young, who would have put up
with his profession. There’s Clara Harfager, for instance, whose
friends don’t know what to do with her; and she has a portion. Then
we might have had her among us. However!—it’s no use being wise for
other people. Where is Celia? Pray let us go in.”</p>
<p>“I am going on immediately to Tipton,” said Dorothea, rather
haughtily. “Good-by.“</p>
<p>Sir James could say nothing as he accompanied her to the
carriage. He was altogether discontented with the result of a
contrivance which had cost him some secret humiliation
beforehand.</p>
<p>Dorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn
corn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came
and rolled down her cheeks, but she did not know it. The world, it
seemed, was turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for
her trustfulness. “It is not true—it is not true!” was the voice
within her that she listened to; but all the while a remembrance to
which there had always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself
on her attention—the remembrance of that day when she had found
Will Ladislaw with Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard his voice
accompanied by the piano.</p>
<p>“He said he would never do anything that I disapproved—I wish I
could have told him that I disapproved of that,” said poor
Dorothea, inwardly, feeling a strange alternation between anger
with Will and the passionate defence of him. “They all try to
blacken him before me; but I will care for no pain, if he is not to
blame. I always believed he was good.”—These were her last thoughts
before she felt that the carriage was passing under the archway of
the lodge-gate at the Grange, when she hurriedly pressed her
handkerchief to her face and began to think of her errands. The
coachman begged leave to take out the horses for half an hour as
there was something wrong with a shoe; and Dorothea, having the
sense that she was going to rest, took off her gloves and bonnet,
while she was leaning against a statue in the entrance-hall, and
talking to the housekeeper. At last she said—</p>
<p>“I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the
library and write you some memoranda from my uncle’s letter, if you
will open the shutters for me.”</p>
<p>“The shutters are open, madam,” said Mrs. Kell, following
Dorothea, who had walked along as she spoke. “Mr. Ladislaw is
there, looking for something.”</p>
<p>(Will had come to fetch a portfolio of his own sketches which he
had missed in the act of packing his movables, and did not choose
to leave behind.)</p>
<p>Dorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow,
but she was not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will
was there was for the moment all-satisfying to her, like the sight
of something precious that one has lost. When she reached the door
she said to Mrs. Kell—</p>
<p>“Go in first, and tell him that I am here.”</p>
<p>Will had found his portfolio, and had laid it on the table at
the far end of the room, to turn over the sketches and please
himself by looking at the memorable piece of art which had a
relation to nature too mysterious for Dorothea. He was smiling at
it still, and shaking the sketches into order with the thought that
he might find a letter from her awaiting him at Middlemarch, when
Mrs. Kell close to his elbow said—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir.”</p>
<p>Will turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was
entering. As Mrs. Kell closed the door behind her they met: each
was looking at the other, and consciousness was overflowed by
something that suppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept
them silent, for they both felt that parting was near, and there is
no shamefacedness in a sad parting.</p>
<p>She moved automatically towards her uncle’s chair against the
writing-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for her,
went a few paces off and stood opposite to her.</p>
<p>“Pray sit down,” said Dorothea, crossing her hands on her lap;
“I am very glad you were here.” Will thought that her face looked
just as it did when she first shook hands with him in Rome; for her
widow’s cap, fixed in her bonnet, had gone off with it, and he
could see that she had lately been shedding tears. But the mixture
of anger in her agitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had
been used, when they were face to face, always to feel confidence
and the happy freedom which comes with mutual understanding, and
how could other people’s words hinder that effect on a sudden? Let
the music which can take possession of our frame and fill the air
with joy for us, sound once more—what does it signify that we heard
it found fault with in its absence?</p>
<p>“I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to
see you,” said Will, seating himself opposite to her. “I am going
away immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you
again.”</p>
<p>“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks
ago—you thought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice
trembling a little.</p>
<p>“Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know
now—things which have altered my feelings about the future. When I
saw you before, I was dreaming that I might come back some day. I
don’t think I ever shall—now.” Will paused here.</p>
<p>“You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and
looking away from her with irritation in his face. ”Of course I
must wish it. I have been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the
eyes of others. There has been a mean implication against my
character. I wish you to know that under no circumstances would I
have lowered myself by—under no circumstances would I have given
men the chance of saying that I sought money under the pretext of
seeking—something else. There was no need of other safeguard
against me—the safeguard of wealth was enough.“</p>
<p>Will rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly
knew where; but it was to the projecting window nearest him, which
had been open as now about the same season a year ago, when he and
Dorothea had stood within it and talked together. Her whole heart
was going out at this moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation:
she only wanted to convince him that she had never done him
injustice, and he seemed to have turned away from her as if she too
had been part of the unfriendly world.</p>
<p>“It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever
attributed any meanness to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way,
wanting to plead with him, she moved from her chair and went in
front of him to her old place in the window, saying, “Do you
suppose that I ever disbelieved in you?”</p>
<p>When Will saw her there, he gave a start and moved backward out
of the window, without meeting her glance. Dorothea was hurt by
this movement following up the previous anger of his tone. She was
ready to say that it was as hard on her as on him, and that she was
helpless; but those strange particulars of their relation which
neither of them could explicitly mention kept her always in dread
of saying too much. At this moment she had no belief that Will
would in any case have wanted to marry her, and she feared using
words which might imply such a belief. She only said earnestly,
recurring to his last word—</p>
<p>“I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.”</p>
<p>Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings
these words of hers seemed to him cruelly neutral, and he looked
pale and miserable after his angry outburst. He went to the table
and fastened up his portfolio, while Dorothea looked at him from
the distance. They were wasting these last moments together in
wretched silence. What could he say, since what had got obstinately
uppermost in his mind was the passionate love for her which he
forbade himself to utter? What could she say, since she might offer
him no help—since she was forced to keep the money that ought to
have been his?—since to-day he seemed not to respond as he used to
do to her thorough trust and liking?</p>
<p>But Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached
the window again.</p>
<p>“I must go,” he said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which
sometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and
burned with gazing too close at a light.</p>
<p>“What shall you do in life?” said Dorothea, timidly. “Have your
intentions remained just the same as when we said good-by
before?”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as
uninteresting. ”I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I
suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope.“</p>
<p>“Oh, what sad words!” said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency
to sob. Then trying to smile, she added, “We used to agree that we
were alike in speaking too strongly.”</p>
<p>“I have not spoken too strongly now,” said Will, leaning back
against the angle of the wall. “There are certain things which a
man can only go through once in his life; and he must know some
time or other that the best is over with him. This experience has
happened to me while I am very young—that is all. What I care more
for than I can ever care for anything else is absolutely forbidden
to me—I don’t mean merely by being out of my reach, but forbidden
me, even if it were within my reach, by my own pride and honor—by
everything I respect myself for. Of course I shall go on living as
a man might do who had seen heaven in a trance.”</p>
<p>Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea
to misunderstand this; indeed he felt that he was contradicting
himself and offending against his self-approval in speaking to her
so plainly; but still—it could not be fairly called wooing a woman
to tell her that he would never woo her. It must be admitted to be
a ghostly kind of wooing.</p>
<p>But Dorothea’s mind was rapidly going over the past with quite
another vision than his. The thought that she herself might be what
Will most cared for did throb through her an instant, but then came
doubt: the memory of the little they had lived through together
turned pale and shrank before the memory which suggested how much
fuller might have been the intercourse between Will and some one
else with whom he had had constant companionship. Everything he had
said might refer to that other relation, and whatever had passed
between him and herself was thoroughly explained by what she had
always regarded as their simple friendship and the cruel
obstruction thrust upon it by her husband’s injurious act. Dorothea
stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily, while images
crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that Will was
referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He wanted her to know
that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.</p>
<p>Will was not surprised at her silence. His mind also was
tumultuously busy while he watched her, and he was feeling rather
wildly that something must happen to hinder their parting—some
miracle, clearly nothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after
all, had she any love for him?—he could not pretend to himself that
he would rather believe her to be without that pain. He could not
deny that a secret longing for the assurance that she loved him was
at the root of all his words.</p>
<p>Neither of them knew how long they stood in that way. Dorothea
was raising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened
and her footman came to say—</p>
<p>“The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start.”</p>
<p>“Presently,“ said Dorothea. Then turning to Will, she said, ”I
have some memoranda to write for the housekeeper.“</p>
<p>“I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing
towards her. “The day after to-morrow I shall leave
Middlemarch.”</p>
<p>“You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low
tone, feeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to
speak.</p>
<p>She put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without
speaking, for her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike
herself. Their eyes met, but there was discontent in his, and in
hers there was only sadness. He turned away and took his portfolio
under his arm.</p>
<p>“I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,” said
Dorothea, repressing a rising sob.</p>
<p>“Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. “As if I
were not in danger of forgetting everything else.”</p>
<p>He had really a movement of anger against her at that moment,
and it impelled him to go away without pause. It was all one flash
to Dorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the
door—the sense that he was no longer there. She sank into the
chair, and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and
emotions were hurrying upon her. Joy came first, in spite of the
threatening train behind it—joy in the impression that it was
really herself whom Will loved and was renouncing, that there was
really no other love less permissible, more blameworthy, which
honor was hurrying him away from. They were parted all the same,
but—Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt her strength return—she
could think of him unrestrainedly. At that moment the parting was
easy to bear: the first sense of loving and being loved excluded
sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had melted, and her
consciousness had room to expand: her past was come back to her
with larger interpretation. The joy was not the less—perhaps it was
the more complete just then—because of the irrevocable parting; for
there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder to imagine in any eye
or from any lips. He had acted so as to defy reproach, and make
wonder respectful.</p>
<p>Any one watching her might have seen that there was a fortifying
thought within her. Just as when inventive power is working with
glad ease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it
were only a cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for
Dorothea to write her memoranda. She spoke her last words to the
housekeeper in cheerful tones, and when she seated herself in the
carriage her eyes were bright and her cheeks blooming under the
dismal bonnet. She threw back the heavy “weepers,“ and looked
before her, wondering which road Will had taken. It was in her
nature to be proud that he was blameless, and through all her
feelings there ran this vein—”I was right to defend him.“</p>
<p>The coachman was used to drive his grays at a good pace, Mr.
Casaubon being unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his
desk, and wanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea
was now bowled along quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the
night had laid the dust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from
the region of the great clouds that sailed in masses. The earth
looked like a happy place under the vast heavens, and Dorothea was
wishing that she might overtake Will and see him once more.</p>
<p>After a turn of the road, there he was with the portfolio under
his arm; but the next moment she was passing him while he raised
his hat, and she felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of
exaltation, leaving him behind. She could not look back at him. It
was as if a crowd of indifferent objects had thrust them asunder,
and forced them along different paths, taking them farther and
farther away from each other, and making it useless to look back.
She could no more make any sign that would seem to say, “Need we
part?” than she could stop the carriage to wait for him. Nay, what
a world of reasons crowded upon her against any movement of her
thought towards a future that might reverse the decision of this
day!</p>
<p>“I only wish I had known before—I wish he knew—then we could be
quite happy in thinking of each other, though we are forever
parted. And if I could but have given him the money, and made
things easier for him!”—were the longings that came back the most
persistently. And yet, so heavily did the world weigh on her in
spite of her independent energy, that with this idea of Will as in
need of such help and at a disadvantage with the world, there came
always the vision of that unfittingness of any closer relation
between them which lay in the opinion of every one connected with
her. She felt to the full all the imperativeness of the motives
which urged Will’s conduct. How could he dream of her defying the
barrier that her husband had placed between them?—how could she
ever say to herself that she would defy it?</p>
<p>Will’s certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance,
had much more bitterness in it. Very slight matters were enough to
gall him in his sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving
past him while he felt himself plodding along as a poor devil
seeking a position in a world which in his present temper offered
him little that he coveted, made his conduct seem a mere matter of
necessity, and took away the sustainment of resolve. After all, he
had no assurance that she loved him: could any man pretend that he
was simply glad in such a case to have the suffering all on his own
side?</p>
<p>That evening Will spent with the Lydgates; the next evening he
was gone.</p>
