<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage (he had
begun to see that this was a world in which even a spirited young
man must sometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him) he set
out at five o'clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to
assure himself that she accepted their new relations willingly.</p>
<p>He found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the
great apple-tree in the orchard. It was a festival with Mrs. Garth,
for her eldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come
home for a short holiday—Christy, who held it the most desirable
thing in the world to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a
regenerate Porson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor
Fred, a sort of object-lesson given to him by the educational
mother. Christy himself, a square-browed, broad-shouldered
masculine edition of his mother not much higher than Fred’s
shoulder—which made it the harder that he should be held
superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought no more of
Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s, wishing
that he himself were more of the same height. He was lying on the
ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over
his eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that
beloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many
young lives. The volume was “Ivanhoe,“ and Jim was in the great
archery scene at the tournament, but suffered much interruption
from Ben, who had fetched his own old bow and arrows, and was
making himself dreadfully disagreeable, Letty thought, by begging
all present to observe his random shots, which no one wished to do
except Brownie, the active-minded but probably shallow mongrel,
while the grizzled Newfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the
dull-eyed neutrality of extreme old age. Letty herself, showing as
to her mouth and pinafore some slight signs that she had been
assisting at the gathering of the cherries which stood in a
coral-heap on the tea-table, was now seated on the grass, listening
open-eyed to the reading.</p>
<p>But the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of
Fred Vincy. When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that
he was on his way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his
bow, and snatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode
across Fred’s outstretched leg, and said “Take me!”</p>
<p>“Oh, and me too,” said Letty.</p>
<p>“You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty,
whose life was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as
a girl.</p>
<p>“I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say
that he had the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put
her hand up to her head and looked with jealous indecision from the
one to the other.</p>
<p>“Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his
arms.</p>
<p>“No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage.
And that old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your
father will come home. We must let Fred go alone. He can tell Mary
that you are here, and she will come back to-morrow.”</p>
<p>Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s
beautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the
advantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even
of looking warm and of pushing his hair back with his
handkerchief.</p>
<p>“Children, run away,” said Mrs. Garth; “it is too warm to hang
about your friends. Take your brother and show him the
rabbits.”</p>
<p>The eldest understood, and led off the children immediately.
Fred felt that Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of
saying anything he had to say, but he could only begin by
observing—</p>
<p>“How glad you must be to have Christy here!”</p>
<p>“Yes; he has come sooner than I expected. He got down from the
coach at nine o’clock, just after his father went out. I am longing
for Caleb to come and hear what wonderful progress Christy is
making. He has paid his expenses for the last year by giving
lessons, carrying on hard study at the same time. He hopes soon to
get a private tutorship and go abroad.”</p>
<p>“He is a great fellow,” said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths
had a medicinal taste, “and no trouble to anybody.” After a slight
pause, he added, “But I fear you will think that I am going to be a
great deal of trouble to Mr. Garth.”</p>
<p>“Caleb likes taking trouble: he is one of those men who always
do more than any one would have thought of asking them to do,”
answered Mrs. Garth. She was knitting, and could either look at
Fred or not, as she chose—always an advantage when one is bent on
loading speech with salutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth
intended to be duly reserved, she did wish to say something that
Fred might be the better for.</p>
<p>“I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good
reason,” said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of
something like a disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have
behaved just the worst to the people I can’t help wishing for the
most from. But while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother
have not given me up, I don’t see why I should give myself up.”
Fred thought it might be well to suggest these masculine examples
to Mrs. Garth.</p>
<p>“Assuredly,“ said she, with gathering emphasis. ”A young man for
whom two such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be
culpable if he threw himself away and made their sacrifices
vain.“</p>
<p>Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said,
“I hope it will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some
encouragement to believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told
you about that? You were not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended,
innocently referring only to his own love as probably evident
enough.</p>
<p>“Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned
Mrs. Garth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive
to the fact that Mary’s friends could not possibly have wished this
beforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. “Yes, I confess I
was surprised.”</p>
<p>“She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I
talked to her myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But
when I asked Mr. Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to
tell me there was a hope.”</p>
<p>The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth
had not yet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even
for <i>her</i> self-control that this blooming youngster should
flourish on the disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a
meal of a nightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while
his family should suppose that hers was in eager need of this
sprig; and her vexation had fermented the more actively because of
its total repression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will
sometimes find scapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic
decision, "You made a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr.
Farebrother to speak for you."</p>
<p>“Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed,
but at a loss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an
apologetic tone, “Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of
ours; and Mary, I knew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it
on himself quite readily.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own
wishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said
Mrs. Garth She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general
doctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of
her worsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.</p>
<p>“I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,”
said Fred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were
beginning to form themselves.</p>
<p>“Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her
words as neatly as possible.</p>
<p>For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety,
and then turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love
with Mary?”</p>
<p>“And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who
ought to be surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting
down beside her and folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of
emotion in her that she should put her work out of her hands. In
fact her feelings were divided between the satisfaction of giving
Fred his discipline and the sense of having gone a little too far.
Fred took his hat and stick and rose quickly.</p>
<p>“Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he
said, in a tone which seemed to demand an answer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garth could not speak immediately. She had brought herself
into the unpleasant position of being called on to say what she
really felt, yet what she knew there were strong reasons for
concealing. And to her the consciousness of having exceeded in
words was peculiarly mortifying. Besides, Fred had given out
unexpected electricity, and he now added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased
that Mary should be attached to me. He could not have known
anything of this.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband,
the fear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily
endurable. She answered, wanting to check unintended
consequences—</p>
<p>“I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows
anything of the matter.”</p>
<p>But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a
subject which she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being
used to stoop in that way; and while she was hesitating there was
already a rush of unintended consequences under the apple-tree
where the tea-things stood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with
Brownie at his heels, and seeing the kitten dragging the knitting
by a lengthening line of wool, shouted and clapped his hands;
Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate, jumped on the tea-table and
upset the milk, then jumped down again and swept half the cherries
with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted sock-top, fitted it
over the kitten’s head as a new source of madness, while Letty
arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it was a
history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack
built.” Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones
came up and the tete-a-tete with Fred was ended. He got away as
soon as he could, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation
of her severity by saying “God bless you” when she shook hands with
him.</p>
<p>She was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of
speaking as “one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and
entreating silence after. But she had not entreated silence, and to
prevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess
all to him that very night. It was curious what an awful tribunal
the mild Caleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up. But she meant
to point out to him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great
deal of good.</p>
<p>No doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to
Lowick. Fred’s light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much
of a bruise as from this suggestion that if he had been out of the
way Mary might have made a thoroughly good match. Also he was
piqued that he had been what he called such a stupid lout as to ask
that intervention from Mr. Farebrother. But it was not in a lover’s
nature—it was not in Fred’s, that the new anxiety raised about
Mary’s feeling should not surmount every other. Notwithstanding his
trust in Mr. Farebrother’s generosity, notwithstanding what Mary
had said to him, Fred could not help feeling that he had a rival:
it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it extremely, not
being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good, being ready
rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the fighting
with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was much
more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this experience
was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his disappointment
about his uncle’s will. The iron had not entered into his soul, but
he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It did not
once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr.
Farebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary.
Mary had been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might
know very little of what had been passing in her mind.</p>
<p>He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with
the three ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated
discussion on some subject which was dropped when he entered, and
Mary was copying the labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers,
in a minute handwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother
was somewhere in the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of
Fred’s peculiar relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of
them to propose that they should walk round the garden, and Fred
predicted to himself that he should have to go away without saying
a word to her in private. He told her first of Christy’s arrival
and then of his own engagement with her father; and he was
comforted by seeing that this latter news touched her keenly. She
said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent over her writing to
hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was a subject which
Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.</p>
<p>“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear
of a young man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you
only mean that things being so, you are glad that he should be
under an excellent man like your father.”</p>
<p>“No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said
Mary, cleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a
dreadfully secular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the
Vicar of Wakefield and Mr. Farebrother.”</p>
<p>“Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large
wooden knitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a
good reason for your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I
put out of the question those who preach new doctrine. But why
should you dislike clergymen?”</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she
seemed to consider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”</p>
<p>“Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in
some anxiety.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” said Mary. “I don’t like the other clergymen’s
neckcloths, because it is they who wear them.”</p>
<p>“How very puzzling!” said Miss Noble, feeling that her own
intellect was probably deficient.</p>
<p>“My dear, you are joking. You would have better reasons than
these for slighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs.
Farebrother, majestically.</p>
<p>“Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be
that it is difficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.</p>
<p>“Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor
of my son,” said the old lady.</p>
<p>Mary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother
came in and had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr.
Garth. At the end he said with quiet satisfaction, “<i>That</i> is
right;" and then bent to look at Mary's labels and praise her
handwriting. Fred felt horribly jealous—was glad, of course, that
Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but wished that he had been ugly
and fat as men at forty sometimes are. It was clear what the end
would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother above everybody, and
these women were all evidently encouraging the affair. He, was
feeling sure that he should have no chance of speaking to Mary,
when Mr. Farebrother said—</p>
<p>“Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study—you
have never seen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I
want you to see a stupendous spider I found this morning.”</p>
<p>Mary at once saw the Vicar’s intention. He had never since the
memorable evening deviated from his old pastoral kindness towards
her, and her momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep.
Mary was accustomed to think rather rigorously of what was
probable, and if a belief flattered her vanity she felt warned to
dismiss it as ridiculous, having early had much exercise in such
dismissals. It was as she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to
admire the fittings of the study, and she had been asked to admire
the spider, Mr. Farebrother said—</p>
<p>“Wait here a minute or two. I am going to look out an engraving
which Fred is tall enough to hang for me. I shall be back in a few
minutes.” And then he went out. Nevertheless, the first word Fred
said to Mary was—</p>
<p>“It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry
Farebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Fred?” Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing
deeply, and surprised out of all her readiness in reply.</p>
<p>“It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly
enough—you who see everything.”</p>
<p>“I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so
of Mr. Farebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way.
How can you have taken up such an idea?”</p>
<p>Fred was rather deep, in spite of his irritation. If Mary had
really been unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her what
Mrs. Garth had said.</p>
<p>“It follows as a matter of course,” he replied. “When you are
continually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you
set up above everybody, I can have no fair chance.”</p>
<p>“You are very ungrateful, Fred,” said Mary. “I wish I had never
told Mr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.”</p>
<p>“No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the
world if it were not for this. I told your father everything, and
he was very kind; he treated me as if I were his son. I could go at
the work with a will, writing and everything, if it were not for
this.”</p>
<p>“For this? for what?” said Mary, imagining now that something
specific must have been said or done.</p>
<p>“This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by
Farebrother.” Mary was appeased by her inclination to laugh.</p>
<p>“Fred,“ she said, peeping round to catch his eyes, which were
sulkily turned away from her, ”you are too delightfully ridiculous.
If you were not such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this
would be to play the wicked coquette, and let you suppose that
somebody besides you has made love to me.“</p>
<p>“Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full
of affection on her, and trying to take her hand.</p>
<p>“I don’t like you at all at this moment,” said Mary, retreating,
and putting her hands behind her. “I only said that no mortal ever
made love to me besides you. And that is no argument that a very
wise man ever will,” she ended, merrily.</p>
<p>“I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think
of him,” said Fred.</p>
<p>“Never dare to mention this any more to me, Fred,” said Mary,
getting serious again. “I don’t know whether it is more stupid or
ungenerous in you not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us
together on purpose that we might speak freely. I am disappointed
that you should be so blind to his delicate feeling.”</p>
<p>There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came
back with the engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room
still with a jealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting
arguments from Mary’s words and manner. The result of the
conversation was on the whole more painful to Mary: inevitably her
attention had taken a new attitude, and she saw the possibility of
new interpretations. She was in a position in which she seemed to
herself to be slighting Mr. Farebrother, and this, in relation to a
man who is much honored, is always dangerous to the firmness of a
grateful woman. To have a reason for going home the next day was a
relief, for Mary earnestly desired to be always clear that she
loved Fred best. When a tender affection has been storing itself in
us through many of our years, the idea that we could accept any
exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives. And we can
set a watch over our affections and our constancy as we can over
other treasures.</p>
<p>“Fred has lost all his other expectations; he must keep this,”
Mary said to herself, with a smile curling her lips. It was
impossible to help fleeting visions of another kind—new dignities
and an acknowledged value of which she had often felt the absence.
But these things with Fred outside them, Fred forsaken and looking
sad for the want of her, could never tempt her deliberate
thought.</p>
