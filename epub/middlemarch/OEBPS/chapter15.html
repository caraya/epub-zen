<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">A</span> great historian, as he insisted on calling himself, who had
the happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to
take his place among the colossi whose huge legs our living
pettiness is observed to walk under, glories in his copious remarks
and digressions as the least imitable part of his work, and
especially in those initial chapters to the successive books of his
history, where he seems to bring his armchair to the proscenium and
chat with us in all the lusty ease of his fine English. But
Fielding lived when the days were longer (for time, like money, is
measured by our needs), when summer afternoons were spacious, and
the clock ticked slowly in the winter evenings. We belated
historians must not linger after his example; and if we did so, it
is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as if delivered
from a campstool in a parrot-house. I at least have so much to do
in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven
and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be
concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that
tempting range of relevancies called the universe.</p>
<p>At present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known
to any one interested in him than he could possibly be even to
those who had seen the most of him since his arrival in
Middlemarch. For surely all must admit that a man may be puffed and
belauded, envied, ridiculed, counted upon as a tool and fallen in
love with, or at least selected as a future husband, and yet remain
virtually unknown—known merely as a cluster of signs for his
neighbors’ false suppositions. There was a general impression,
however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common country doctor,
and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was significant
of great things being expected from him. For everybody’s family
doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have
immeasurable skill in the management and training of the most
skittish or vicious diseases. The evidence of his cleverness was of
the higher intuitive order, lying in his lady-patients’ immovable
conviction, and was unassailable by any objection except that their
intuitions were opposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw
medical truth in Wrench and “the strengthening treatment” regarding
Toller and “the lowering system” as medical perdition. For the
heroic times of copious bleeding and blistering had not yet
departed, still less the times of thorough-going theory, when
disease in general was called by some bad name, and treated
accordingly without shilly-shally—as if, for example, it were to be
called insurrection, which must not be fired on with
blank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The
strengtheners and the lowerers were all “clever“ men in somebody’s
opinion, which is really as much as can be said for any living
talents. Nobody’s imagination had gone so far as to conjecture that
Mr. Lydgate could know as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the
two physicians, who alone could offer any hope when danger was
extreme, and when the smallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I
repeat, there was a general impression that Lydgate was something
rather more uncommon than any general practitioner in Middlemarch.
And this was true. He was but seven-and-twenty, an age at which
many men are not quite common—at which they are hopeful of
achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking that Mammon shall
never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their backs, but
rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him, shall
draw their chariot.</p>
<p>He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public
school. His father, a military man, had made but little provision
for three children, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a
medical education, it seemed easier to his guardians to grant his
request by apprenticing him to a country practitioner than to make
any objections on the score of family dignity. He was one of the
rarer lads who early get a decided bent and make up their minds
that there is something particular in life which they would like to
do for its own sake, and not because their fathers did it. Most of
us who turn to any subject with love remember some morning or
evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried
volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker, or for
very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the
first traceable beginning of our love. Something of that sort
happened to Lydgate. He was a quick fellow, and when hot from play,
would toss himself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep in any
sort of book that he could lay his hands on: if it were Rasselas or
Gulliver, so much the better, but Bailey’s Dictionary would do, or
the Bible with the Apocrypha in it. Something he must read, when he
was not riding the pony, or running and hunting, or listening to
the talk of men. All this was true of him at ten years of age; he
had then read through “Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea,”
which was neither milk for babes, nor any chalky mixture meant to
pass for milk, and it had already occurred to him that books were
stuff, and that life was stupid. His school studies had not much
modified that opinion, for though he “did“ his classics and
mathematics, he was not pre-eminent in them. It was said of him,
that Lydgate could do anything he liked, but he had certainly not
yet liked to do anything remarkable. He was a vigorous animal with
a ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an
intellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial
affair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his
elders, he had apparently got already more than was necessary for
mature life. Probably this was not an exceptional result of
expensive teaching at that period of short-waisted coats, and other
fashions which have not yet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day
sent him to the small home library to hunt once more for a book
which might have some freshness for him: in vain! unless, indeed,
he took down a dusty row of volumes with gray-paper backs and dingy
labels—the volumes of an old Cyclopaedia which he had never
disturbed. It would at least be a novelty to disturb them. They
were on the highest shelf, and he stood on a chair to get them
down. But he opened the volume which he first took from the shelf:
somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift attitude, just where it
might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he opened on was under
the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that drew his eyes was
on the valves of the heart. He was not much acquainted with valves
of any sort, but he knew that valvae were folding-doors, and
through this crevice came a sudden light startling him with his
first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the human frame.
A liberal education had of course left him free to read the
indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general
sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal
structure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for
anything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and
he had no more thought of representing to himself how his blood
circulated than how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of
vocation had come, and before he got down from his chair, the world
was made new to him by a presentiment of endless processes filling
the vast spaces planked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance
which he had supposed to be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt
the growth of an intellectual passion.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes
to fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her, or else be
fatally parted from her. Is it due to excess of poetry or of
stupidity that we are never weary of describing what King James
called a woman’s “makdom and her fairnesse,” never weary of
listening to the twanging of the old Troubadour strings, and are
comparatively uninterested in that other kind of “makdom and
fairnesse” which must be wooed with industrious thought and patient
renunciation of small desires? In the story of this passion, too,
the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious marriage,
sometimes frustration and final parting. And not seldom the
catastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the
Troubadours. For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about
their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the
same way as the tie of their cravats, there is always a good number
who once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a
little. The story of their coming to be shapen after the average
and fit to be packed by the gross, is hardly ever told even in
their consciousness; for perhaps their ardor in generous unpaid
toil cooled as imperceptibly as the ardor of other youthful loves,
till one day their earlier self walked like a ghost in its old home
and made the new furniture ghastly. Nothing in the world more
subtle than the process of their gradual change! In the beginning
they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may have sent some of our
breath towards infecting them, when we uttered our conforming
falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps it came with
the vibrations from a woman’s glance.</p>
<p>Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was
the better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took
the form of a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in
his bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in
makeshift called his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies
in London, Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical
profession as it might be was the finest in the world; presenting
the most perfect interchange between science and art; offering the
most direct alliance between intellectual conquest and the social
good. Lydgate’s nature demanded this combination: he was an
emotional creature, with a flesh-and-blood sense of fellowship
which withstood all the abstractions of special study. He cared not
only for “cases,“ but for John and Elizabeth, especially
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted
reform, and gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to
reject its venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the
possessor of genuine though undemanded qualifications. He went to
study in Paris with the determination that when he provincial home
again he would settle in some provincial town as a general
practitioner, and resist the irrational severance between medical
and surgical knowledge in the interest of his own scientific
pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would keep away
from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social
truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done,
by the independent value of his work. For it must be remembered
that this was a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges
which used great efforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it
scarce, and to exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation
to fees and appointments, it happened that very ignorant young
gentlemen were promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to
practise over large areas in the country. Also, the high standard
held up to the public mind by the College of which which gave its
peculiar sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical
instruction obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not
hinder quackery from having an excellent time of it; for since
professional practice chiefly consisted in giving a great many
drugs, the public inferred that it might be better off with more
drugs still, if they could only be got cheaply, and hence swallowed
large cubic measures of physic prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance
which had taken no degrees. Considering that statistics had not yet
embraced a calculation as to the number of ignorant or canting
doctors which absolutely must exist in the teeth of all changes, it
seemed to Lydgate that a change in the units was the most direct
mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be a unit who would make
a certain amount of difference towards that spreading change which
would one day tell appreciably upon the averages, and in the mean
time have the pleasure of making an advantageous difference to the
viscera of his own patients. But he did not simply aim at a more
genuine kind of practice than was common. He was ambitious of a
wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that he might work
out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the
chain of discovery.</p>
<p>Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon
should dream of himself as a discoverer? Most of us, indeed, know
little of the great originators until they have been lifted up
among the constellations and already rule our fates. But that
Herschel, for example, who “broke the barriers of the heavens”—did
he not once play a provincial church-organ, and give music-lessons
to stumbling pianists? Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on
the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait
and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to
everlasting fame: each of them had his little local personal
history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares, which
made the retarding friction of his course towards final
companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not blind to the
dangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his
resolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty,
he felt himself experienced. And he was not going to have his
vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of
the capital, but to live among people who could hold no rivalry
with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object
with the assiduous practice of his profession. There was
fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each
other: the careful observation and inference which was his daily
work, the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases,
would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry. Was
not this the typical pre-eminence of his profession? He would be a
good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very means keep himself in the
track of far-reaching investigation. On one point he may fairly
claim approval at this particular stage of his career: he did not
mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of
poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing
adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may have
leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He intended to
begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite
certainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the
demonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was
to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and
simply prescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage
from druggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to
adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town, and
would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren.
But Lydgate meant to innovate in his treatment also, and he was
wise enough to see that the best security for his practising
honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic
temptations to the contrary.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and
theorizers than the present; we are apt to think it the finest era
of the world when America was beginning to be discovered, when a
bold sailor, even if he were wrecked, might alight on a new
kingdom; and about 1829 the dark territories of Pathology were a
fine America for a spirited young adventurer. Lydgate was ambitious
above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational
basis of his profession. The more he became interested in special
questions of disease, such as the nature of fever or fevers, the
more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of
structure which just at the beginning of the century had been
illuminated by the brief and glorious career of Bichat, who died
when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another Alexander, left
a realm large enough for many heirs. That great Frenchman first
carried out the conception that living bodies, fundamentally
considered, are not associations of organs which can be understood
by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally; but
must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,
out of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are
compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in
various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the
rest, each material having its peculiar composition and
proportions. No man, one sees, can understand and estimate the
entire structure or its parts—what are its frailties and what its
repairs, without knowing the nature of the materials. And the
conception wrought out by Bichat, with his detailed study of the
different tissues, acted necessarily on medical questions as the
turning of gas-light would act on a dim, oil-lit street, showing
new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must
be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and
the action of medicaments. But results which depend on human
conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of
1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along
the old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which
might have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat’s. This great
seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate
facts in the living organism, marking the limit of anatomical
analysis; but it was open to another mind to say, have not these
structures some common basis from which they have all started, as
your sarsnet, gauze, net, satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon?
Here would be another light, as of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very
grain of things, and revising all former explanations. Of this
sequence to Bichat’s work, already vibrating along many currents of
the European mind, Lydgate was enamoured; he longed to demonstrate
the more intimate relations of living structure, and help to define
men’s thought more accurately after the true order. The work had
not yet been done, but only prepared for those who knew how to use
the preparation. What was the primitive tissue? In that way Lydgate
put the question—not quite in the way required by the awaiting
answer; but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers.
And he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized, for
taking up the threads of investigation—on many hints to be won from
diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but of the
microscope, which research had begun to use again with new
enthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate’s plan of his future: to
do good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the
world.</p>
<p>He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be
seven-and-twenty, without any fixed vices, with a generous
resolution that his action should be beneficent, and with ideas in
his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of
horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance, which the
eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would
certainly not have gone far in paying for. He was at a
starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine subject for
betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who
could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous
purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of
circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man
swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong. The risk
would remain even with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for
character too is a process and an unfolding. The man was still in
the making, as much as the Middlemarch doctor and immortal
discoverer, and there were both virtues and faults capable of
shrinking or expanding. The faults will not, I hope, be a reason
for the withdrawal of your interest in him. Among our valued
friends is there not some one or other who is a little too
self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little
spotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and
protuberant there with native prejudices; or whose better energies
are liable to lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of
transient solicitations? All these things might be alleged against
Lydgate, but then, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher,
who talks of Adam, and would not like to mention anything painful
to the pew-renters. The particular faults from which these delicate
generalities are distilled have distinguishable physiognomies,
diction, accent, and grimaces; filling up parts in very various
dramas. Our vanities differ as our noses do: all conceit is not the
same conceit, but varies in correspondence with the minutiae of
mental make in which one of us differs from another. Lydgate’s
conceit was of the arrogant sort, never simpering, never
impertinent, but massive in its claims and benevolently
contemptuous. He would do a great deal for noodles, being sorry for
them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power over
him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in
Paris, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines.
All his faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a
man who had a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and
who even in his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction.
Where then lay the spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured
of that careless grace. How could there be any commonness in a man
so well-bred, so ambitious of social distinction, so generous and
unusual in his views of social duty? As easily as there may be
stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong
subject, or as many a man who has the best will to advance the
social millennium might be ill-inspired in imagining its lighter
pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music, or the brilliant
punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate’s spots of commonness lay in
the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of noble
intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in
ordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged
to his intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and
judgment about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its
being known (without his telling) that he was better born than
other country surgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at
present; but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither
biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of
feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not
being of the best.</p>
<p>As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by
impetuous folly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some
distant period would of course not be impetuous. For those who want
to be acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that
case of impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the
fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone, together with the
chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable. The
story can be told without many words. It happened when he was
studying in Paris, and just at the time when, over and above his
other work, he was occupied with some galvanic experiments. One
evening, tired with his experimenting, and not being able to elicit
the facts he needed, he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose
under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained
shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the Porte
Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had already seen
several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the
collaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab
her lover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece.
Lydgate was in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a
woman whom he never expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with
dark eyes, a Greek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that
sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth,
and her voice was a soft cooing. She had but lately come to Paris,
and bore a virtuous reputation, her husband acting with her as the
unfortunate lover. It was her acting which was “no better than it
should be,” but the public was satisfied. Lydgate’s only relaxation
now was to go and look at this woman, just as he might have thrown
himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets
for a while, without prejudice to his galvanism, to which he would
presently return. But this evening the old drama had a new
catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing
of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife veritably
stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek
pierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a
swoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this
time. Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the
stage, and was active in help, making the acquaintance of his
heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently
in his arms. Paris rang with the story of this death:—was it a
murder? Some of the actress’s warmest admirers were inclined to
believe in her guilt, and liked her the better for it (such was the
taste of those times); but Lydgate was not one of these. He
vehemently contended for her innocence, and the remote impersonal
passion for her beauty which he had felt before, had passed now
into personal devotion, and tender thought of her lot. The notion
of murder was absurd: no motive was discoverable, the young couple
being understood to dote on each other; and it was not
unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have
brought these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in
Madame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had had many
interviews with her, and found her more and more adorable. She
talked little; but that was an additional charm. She was
melancholy, and seemed grateful; her presence was enough, like that
of the evening light. Lydgate was madly anxious about her
affection, and jealous lest any other man than himself should win
it and ask her to marry him. But instead of reopening her
engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would have been all
the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris without
warning, forsaking her little court of admirers. Perhaps no one
carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had
come to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken
by ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no
faithful comforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult
to find as some other hidden facts, and it was not long before
Lydgate gathered indications that Laure had taken the route to
Lyons. He found her at last acting with great success at Avignon
under the same name, looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken
wife carrying her child in her arms. He spoke to her after the
play, was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him
beautiful as clear depths of water, and obtained leave to visit her
the next day; when he was bent on telling her that he adored her,
and on asking her to marry him. He knew that this was like the
sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his habitual
foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved to
do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to
accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange,
that some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our
infatuations, and even while we rave on the heights, behold the
wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us.</p>
<p>To have approached Laure with any suit that was not
reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his
whole feeling towards her.</p>
<p>“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to
him the next day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking
at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating
animal wonders. “Are all Englishmen like that?”</p>
<p>“I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You
are lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will
wait, but I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one
else.”</p>
<p>Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from
under her grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty,
and knelt close to her knees.</p>
<p>“I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way,
keeping her arms folded. “My foot really slipped.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly. “It was a fatal
accident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the
more.”</p>
<p>Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “<i>I meant
to do it.</i>"</p>
<p>Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments
seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.</p>
<p>“There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently.
“He was brutal to you: you hated him.”</p>
<p>“No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and
not in my country; that was not agreeable to me.”</p>
<p>“Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. “And you
planned to murder him?”</p>
<p>“I did not plan: it came to me in the play—<i>I meant to do
it.</i>"</p>
<p>Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while
he looked at her. He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given
his young adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.</p>
<p>“You are a good young man,” she said. “But I do not like
husbands. I will never have another.”</p>
<p>Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his
Paris chambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him. He
was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his
heart and his belief that human life might be made better. But he
had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment, now that it
was so experienced; and henceforth he would take a strictly
scientific view of woman, entertaining no expectations but such as
were justified beforehand.</p>
<p>No one in Middle march was likely to have such a notion of
Lydgate’s past as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the
respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals
generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation
to themselves of what did not come under their own senses. Not only
young virgins of that town, but gray-bearded men also, were often
in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into
their purposes, contented with very vague knowledge as to the way
in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality.
Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing Lydgate and
assimilating him very comfortably.</p>
