        They said of old the Soul had human shape,<br/>
        But smaller, subtler than the fleshly self,<br/>
        So wandered forth for airing when it pleased.<br/>
        And see! beside her cherub-face there floats<br/>
        A pale-lipped form aerial whispering<br/>
        Its promptings in that little shell her ear."

are) when they are buzzing in search of their particular nectar.
This fine comparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that
evening at Lowick Parsonage heard a lively discussion among the
ladies on the news which their old servant had got from Tantripp
concerning Mr. Casaubon's strange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a
codicil to his will made not long before his death. Miss Winifred
was astounded to find that her brother had known the fact before,
and observed that Camden was the most wonderful man for knowing
things and not telling them; whereupon Mary Garth said that the
codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of spiders, which
Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother considered
that the news had something to do with their having only once seen
Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small
compassionate mewings.</p>
<p>Fred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the
Casaubons, and his mind never recurred to that discussion till one
day calling on Rosamond at his mother’s request to deliver a
message as he passed, he happened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred
and Rosamond had little to say to each other now that marriage had
removed her from collision with the unpleasantness of brothers, and
especially now that he had taken what she held the stupid and even
reprehensible step of giving up the Church to take to such a
business as Mr. Garth’s. Hence Fred talked by preference of what he
considered indifferent news, and “a propos of that young Ladislaw”
mentioned what he had heard at Lowick Parsonage.</p>
<p>Now Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than
he told, and when he had once been set thinking about the relation
between Will and Dorothea his conjectures had gone beyond the fact.
He imagined that there was a passionate attachment on both sides,
and this struck him as much too serious to gossip about. He
remembered Will’s irritability when he had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon,
and was the more circumspect. On the whole his surmises, in
addition to what he knew of the fact, increased his friendliness
and tolerance towards Ladislaw, and made him understand the
vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch after he had said that he
should go away. It was significant of the separateness between
Lydgate’s mind and Rosamond’s that he had no impulse to speak to
her on the subject; indeed, he did not quite trust her reticence
towards Will. And he was right there; though he had no vision of
the way in which her mind would act in urging her to speak.</p>
<p>When she repeated Fred’s news to Lydgate, he said, “Take care
you don’t drop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. He is likely to
fly out as if you insulted him. Of course it is a painful
affair.”</p>
<p>Rosamond turned her neck and patted her hair, looking the image
of placid indifference. But the next time Will came when Lydgate
was away, she spoke archly about his not going to London as he had
threatened.</p>
<p>“I know all about it. I have a confidential little bird,” said
she, showing very pretty airs of her head over the bit of work held
high between her active fingers. “There is a powerful magnet in
this neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“To be sure there is. Nobody knows that better than you,” said
Will, with light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry.</p>
<p>“It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous,
and foreseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would
so much like to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry
her as a certain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by
making her forfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman—and
then—and then—and then—oh, I have no doubt the end will be
thoroughly romantic.”</p>
<p>“Great God! what do you mean?” said Will, flushing over face and
ears, his features seeming to change as if he had had a violent
shake. “Don’t joke; tell me what you mean.”</p>
<p>“You don’t really know?” said Rosamond, no longer playful, and
desiring nothing better than to tell in order that she might evoke
effects.</p>
<p>“No!“ he returned, impatiently.</p>
<p>“Don’t know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if
Mrs. Casaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property?”</p>
<p>“How do you know that it is true?” said Will, eagerly.</p>
<p>“My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers.” Will started
up from his chair and reached his hat.</p>
<p>“I dare say she likes you better than the property,” said
Rosamond, looking at him from a distance.</p>
<p>“Pray don’t say any more about it,” said Will, in a hoarse
undertone extremely unlike his usual light voice. “It is a foul
insult to her and to me.” Then he sat down absently, looking before
him, but seeing nothing.</p>
<p>“Now you are angry with <i>me</i>," said Rosamond. "It is too
bad to bear <i>me</i> malice. You ought to be obliged to me for
telling you."</p>
<p>“So I am,” said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of
double soul which belongs to dreamers who answer questions.</p>
<p>“I expect to hear of the marriage,” said Rosamond,
playfully.</p>
<p>“Never! You will never hear of the marriage!”</p>
<p>With those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his
hand to Rosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went
away.</p>
<p>When he was gone, Rosamond left her chair and walked to the
other end of the room, leaning when she got there against a
chiffonniere, and looking out of the window wearily. She was
oppressed by ennui, and by that dissatisfaction which in women’s
minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy, referring to
no real claims, springing from no deeper passion than the vague
exactingness of egoism, and yet capable of impelling action as well
as speech. “There really is nothing to care for much,” said poor
Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at Quallingham, who did
not write to her; and that perhaps Tertius when he came home would
tease her about expenses. She had already secretly disobeyed him by
asking her father to help them, and he had ended decisively by
saying, “I am more likely to want help myself.”</p>
