<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he same night, when Mr. Bulstrode returned from a journey to
Brassing on business, his good wife met him in the entrance-hall
and drew him into his private sitting-room.</p>
<p>“Nicholas,“ she said, fixing her honest eyes upon him anxiously,
”there has been such a disagreeable man here asking for you—it has
made me quite uncomfortable.“</p>
<p>“What kind of man, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, dreadfully
certain of the answer.</p>
<p>“A red-faced man with large whiskers, and most impudent in his
manner. He declared he was an old friend of yours, and said you
would be sorry not to see him. He wanted to wait for you here, but
I told him he could see you at the Bank to-morrow morning. Most
impudent he was!—stared at me, and said his friend Nick had luck in
wives. I don’t believe he would have gone away, if Blucher had not
happened to break his chain and come running round on the
gravel—for I was in the garden; so I said, ’You’d better go
away—the dog is very fierce, and I can’t hold him.’ Do you really
know anything of such a man?”</p>
<p>“I believe I know who he is, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in
his usual subdued voice, “an unfortunate dissolute wretch, whom I
helped too much in days gone by. However, I presume you will not be
troubled by him again. He will probably come to the Bank—to beg,
doubtless.”</p>
<p>No more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr.
Bulstrode had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner.
His wife, not sure that he was come home, looked into his
dressing-room and saw him with his coat and cravat off, leaning one
arm on a chest of drawers and staring absently at the ground. He
started nervously and looked up as she entered.</p>
<p>“You look very ill, Nicholas. Is there anything the matter?”</p>
<p>“I have a good deal of pain in my head,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who
was so frequently ailing that his wife was always ready to believe
in this cause of depression.</p>
<p>“Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar.”</p>
<p>Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally
the affectionate attention soothed him. Though always polite, it
was his habit to receive such services with marital coolness, as
his wife’s duty. But to-day, while she was bending over him, he
said, “You are very good, Harriet,” in a tone which had something
new in it to her ear; she did not know exactly what the novelty
was, but her woman’s solicitude shaped itself into a darting
thought that he might be going to have an illness.</p>
<p>“Has anything worried you?” she said. “Did that man come to you
at the Bank?”</p>
<p>“Yes; it was as I had supposed. He is a man who at one time
might have done better. But he has sunk into a drunken debauched
creature.”</p>
<p>“Is he quite gone away?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, anxiously but for
certain reasons she refrained from adding, “It was very
disagreeable to hear him calling himself a friend of yours.” At
that moment she would not have liked to say anything which implied
her habitual consciousness that her husband’s earlier connections
were not quite on a level with her own. Not that she knew much
about them. That her husband had at first been employed in a bank,
that he had afterwards entered into what he called city business
and gained a fortune before he was three-and-thirty, that he had
married a widow who was much older than himself—a Dissenter, and in
other ways probably of that disadvantageous quality usually
perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the dispassionate
judgment of a second—was almost as much as she had cared to learn
beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode’s narrative occasionally
gave of his early bent towards religion, his inclination to be a
preacher, and his association with missionary and philanthropic
efforts. She believed in him as an excellent man whose piety
carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose
influence had turned her own mind toward seriousness, and whose
share of perishable good had been the means of raising her own
position. But she also liked to think that it was well in every
sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand of Harriet Vincy;
whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light—a better light
surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or dissenting
chapel-yards. The unreformed provincial mind distrusted London; and
while true religion was everywhere saving, honest Mrs. Bulstrode
was convinced that to be saved in the Church was more respectable.
She so much wished to ignore towards others that her husband had
ever been a London Dissenter, that she liked to keep it out of
sight even in talking to him. He was quite aware of this; indeed in
some respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose
imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who
had nothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a
thorough inclination still subsisting. But his fears were such as
belong to a man who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy: the
loss of high consideration from his wife, as from every one else
who did not clearly hate him out of enmity to the truth, would be
as the beginning of death to him. When she said—</p>
<p>“Is he quite gone away?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I trust so,” he answered, with an effort to throw as much
sober unconcern into his tone as possible!</p>
<p>But in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet
trust. In the interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident
that his eagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any
other greed. He had frankly said that he had turned out of the way
to come to Middlemarch, just to look about him and see whether the
neighborhood would suit him to live in. He had certainly had a few
debts to pay more than he expected, but the two hundred pounds were
not gone yet: a cool five-and-twenty would suffice him to go away
with for the present. What he had wanted chiefly was to see his
friend Nick and family, and know all about the prosperity of a man
to whom he was so much attached. By-and-by he might come back for a
longer stay. This time Raffles declined to be “seen off the
premises,” as he expressed it—declined to quit Middlemarch under
Bulstrode’s eyes. He meant to go by coach the next day—if he
chose.</p>
<p>Bulstrode felt himself helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing
could avail: he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any
promise. On the contrary, he felt a cold certainty at his heart
that Raffles—unless providence sent death to hinder him—would come
back to Middlemarch before long. And that certainty was a
terror.</p>
<p>It was not that he was in danger of legal punishment or of
beggary: he was in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment
of his neighbors and the mournful perception of his wife certain
facts of his past life which would render him an object of scorn
and an opprobrium of the religion with which he had diligently
associated himself. The terror of being judged sharpens the memory:
it sends an inevitable glare over that long-unvisited past which
has been habitually recalled only in general phrases. Even without
memory, the life is bound into one by a zone of dependence in
growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man to own his
blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened wound, a
man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn preparation of
the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose from the life:
it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing shudders and
bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame.</p>
<p>Into this second life Bulstrode’s past had now risen, only the
pleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day,
without interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect
and fear into a fantastic present, he felt the scenes of his
earlier life coming between him and everything else, as obstinately
as when we look through the window from a lighted room, the objects
we turn our backs on are still before us, instead of the grass and
the trees The successive events inward and outward were there in
one view: though each might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still
kept their hold in the consciousness.</p>
<p>Once more he saw himself the young banker’s clerk, with an
agreeable person, as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech
and fond of theological definition: an eminent though young member
of a Calvinistic dissenting church at Highbury, having had striking
experience in conviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again he heard
himself called for as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings,
speaking on religious platforms, preaching in private houses. Again
he felt himself thinking of the ministry as possibly his vocation,
and inclined towards missionary labor. That was the happiest time
of his life: that was the spot he would have chosen now to awake in
and find the rest a dream. The people among whom Brother Bulstrode
was distinguished were very few, but they were very near to him,
and stirred his satisfaction the more; his power stretched through
a narrow space, but he felt its effect the more intensely. He
believed without effort in the peculiar work of grace within him,
and in the signs that God intended him for special
instrumentality.</p>
<p>Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of
promotion he had when he, an orphan educated at a commercial
charity-school, was invited to a fine villa belonging to Mr.
Dunkirk, the richest man in the congregation. Soon he became an
intimate there, honored for his piety by the wife, marked out for
his ability by the husband, whose wealth was due to a flourishing
city and west-end trade. That was the setting-in of a new current
for his ambition, directing his prospects of “instrumentality“
towards the uniting of distinguished religious gifts with
successful business.</p>
<p>By-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential
subordinate partner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so
well fitted to fill the severely felt vacancy as his young friend
Bulstrode, if he would become confidential accountant. The offer
was accepted. The business was a pawnbroker’s, of the most
magnificent sort both in extent and profits; and on a short
acquaintance with it Bulstrode became aware that one source of
magnificent profit was the easy reception of any goods offered,
without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But there was a
branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess to give
suggestions of shame.</p>
<p>He remembered his first moments of shrinking. They were private,
and were filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of
prayer. The business was established and had old roots; is it not
one thing to set up a new gin-palace and another to accept an
investment in an old one? The profits made out of lost souls—where
can the line be drawn at which they begin in human transactions?
Was it not even God’s way of saving His chosen? “Thou knowest,”—the
young Bulstrode had said then, as the older Bulstrode was saying
now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul sits from these things—how I
view them all as implements for tilling Thy garden rescued here and
there from the wilderness.”</p>
<p>Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual
experiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of
his position seem a service demanded of him: the vista of a fortune
had already opened itself, and Bulstrode’s shrinking remained
private. Mr. Dunkirk had never expected that there would be any
shrinking at all: he had never conceived that trade had anything to
do with the scheme of salvation. And it was true that Bulstrode
found himself carrying on two distinct lives; his religious
activity could not be incompatible with his business as soon as he
had argued himself into not feeling it incompatible.</p>
<p>Mentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same
pleas—indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into
intricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral
sensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying,
his soul had become more saturated with the belief that he did
everything for God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his own. And
yet—if he could be back in that far-off spot with his youthful
poverty—why, then he would choose to be a missionary.</p>
<p>But the train of causes in which he had locked himself went on.
There was trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the
only daughter had run away, defied her parents, and gone on the
stage; and now the only boy died, and after a short time Mr.
Dunkirk died also. The wife, a simple pious woman, left with all
the wealth in and out of the magnificent trade, of which she never
knew the precise nature, had come to believe in Bulstrode, and
innocently adore him as women often adore their priest or
“man-made“ minister. It was natural that after a time marriage
should have been thought of between them. But Mrs. Dunkirk had
qualms and yearnings about her daughter, who had long been regarded
as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the daughter
had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight. The mother,
having lost her boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a double
sense to reclaim her daughter. If she were found, there would be a
channel for property—perhaps a wide one—in the provision for
several grandchildren. Efforts to find her must be made before Mrs.
Dunkirk would marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after
advertisement as well as other modes of inquiry had been tried, the
mother believed that her daughter was not to be found, and
consented to marry without reservation of property.</p>
<p>The daughter had been found; but only one man besides Bulstrode
knew it, and he was paid for keeping silence and carrying himself
away.</p>
<p>That was the bare fact which Bulstrode was now forced to see in
the rigid outline with which acts present themselves onlookers. But
for himself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory,
the fact was broken into little sequences, each justified as it
came by reasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode’s
course up to that time had, he thought, been sanctioned by
remarkable providences, appearing to point the way for him to be
the agent in making the best use of a large property and
withdrawing it from perversion. Death and other striking
dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come; and
Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do you call these
bare events? The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively
small, but the essential condition was there—namely, that they were
in favor of his own ends. It was easy for him to settle what was
due from him to others by inquiring what were God’s intentions with
regard to himself. Could it be for God’s service that this fortune
should in any considerable proportion go to a young woman and her
husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits, and might
scatter it abroad in triviality—people who seemed to lie outside
the path of remarkable providences? Bulstrode had never said to
himself beforehand, “The daughter shall not be found”—nevertheless
when the moment came he kept her existence hidden; and when other
moments followed, he soothed the mother with consolation in the
probability that the unhappy young woman might be no more.</p>
<p>There were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his action was
unrighteous; but how could he go back? He had mental exercises,
called himself nought laid hold on redemption, and went on in his
course of instrumentality. And after five years Death again came to
widen his path, by taking away his wife. He did gradually withdraw
his capital, but he did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an
end to the business, which was carried on for thirteen years
afterwards before it finally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas
Bulstrode had used his hundred thousand discreetly, and was become
provincially, solidly important—a banker, a Churchman, a public
benefactor; also a sleeping partner in trading concerns, in which
his ability was directed to economy in the raw material, as in the
case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy’s silk. And now, when this
respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly thirty years—when
all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the
consciousness—that past had risen and immersed his thought as if
with the terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the
feeble being.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned
something momentous, something which entered actively into the
struggle of his longings and terrors. There, he thought, lay an
opening towards spiritual, perhaps towards material rescue.</p>
<p>The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him. There
may be coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and
emotions for the sake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not
one of them. He was simply a man whose desires had been stronger
than his theoretic beliefs, and who had gradually explained the
gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with those
beliefs. If this be hypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself
occasionally in us all, to whatever confession we belong, and
whether we believe in the future perfection of our race or in the
nearest date fixed for the end of the world; whether we regard the
earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved remnant, including
ourselves, or have a passionate belief in the solidarity of
mankind.</p>
<p>The service he could do to the cause of religion had been
through life the ground he alleged to himself for his choice of
action: it had been the motive which he had poured out in his
prayers. Who would use money and position better than he meant to
use them? Who could surpass him in self-abhorrence and exaltation
of God’s cause? And to Mr. Bulstrode God’s cause was something
distinct from his own rectitude of conduct: it enforced a
discrimination of God’s enemies, who were to be used merely as
instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep out
of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in
trades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most
active devices, became sanctified by a right application of the
profits in the hands of God’s servant.</p>
<p>This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to
evangelical belief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives
is peculiar to Englishmen. There is no general doctrine which is
not capable of eating out our morality if unchecked by the
deep-seated habit of direct fellow-feeling with individual
fellow-men.</p>
<p>But a man who believes in something else than his own greed, has
necessarily a conscience or standard to which he more or less
adapts himself. Bulstrode’s standard had been his serviceableness
to God’s cause: “I am sinful and nought—a vessel to be consecrated
by use—but use me!”—had been the mould into which he had
constrained his immense need of being something important and
predominating. And now had come a moment in which that mould seemed
in danger of being broken and utterly cast away.</p>
<p>What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made
him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the
pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were
to be the ruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as
one who had brought unclean offerings.</p>
<p>He had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a
repentance had come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a
threatening Providence urged him to a kind of propitiation which
was not simply a doctrinal transaction. The divine tribunal had
changed its aspect for him; self-prostration was no longer enough,
and he must bring restitution in his hand. It was really before his
God that Bulstrode was about to attempt such restitution as seemed
possible: a great dread had seized his susceptible frame, and the
scorching approach of shame wrought in him a new spiritual need.
Night and day, while the resurgent threatening past was making a
conscience within him, he was thinking by what means he could
recover peace and trust—by what sacrifice he could stay the rod.
His belief in these moments of dread was, that if he spontaneously
did something right, God would save him from the consequences of
wrong-doing. For religion can only change when the emotions which
fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear remains
nearly at the level of the savage.</p>
<p>He had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach,
and this was a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an
immediate dread, but did not put an end to the spiritual conflict
and the need to win protection. At last he came to a difficult
resolve, and wrote a letter to Will Ladislaw, begging him to be at
the Shrubs that evening for a private interview at nine o’clock.
Will had felt no particular surprise at the request, and connected
it with some new notions about the “Pioneer;“ but when he was shown
into Mr. Bulstrode’s private room, he was struck with the painfully
worn look on the banker’s face, and was going to say, ”Are you
ill?“ when, checking himself in that abruptness, he only inquired
after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her satisfaction with the picture bought
for her.</p>
<p>“Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her
daughters this evening. I begged you to come, Mr. Ladislaw, because
I have a communication of a very private—indeed, I will say, of a
sacredly confidential nature, which I desire to make to you.
Nothing, I dare say, has been farther from your thoughts than that
there had been important ties in the past which could connect your
history with mine.”</p>
<p>Will felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a
state of keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the
subject of ties in the past, and his presentiments were not
agreeable. It seemed like the fluctuations of a dream—as if the
action begun by that loud bloated stranger were being carried on by
this pale-eyed sickly looking piece of respectability, whose
subdued tone and glib formality of speech were at this moment
almost as repulsive to him as their remembered contrast. He
answered, with a marked change of color—</p>
<p>“No, indeed, nothing.”</p>
<p>“You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken.
But for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am
before the bar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under
no compulsion to make the disclosure which has been my object in
asking you to come here to-night. So far as human laws go, you have
no claim on me whatever.”</p>
<p>Will was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode
had paused, leaning his head on his hand, and looking at the floor.
But he now fixed his examining glance on Will and said—</p>
<p>“I am told that your mother’s name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that
she ran away from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your
father was at one time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you
can confirm these statements?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in
which an inquiry had come, that might have been expected to be
preliminary to the banker’s previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had
to-night followed the order of his emotions; he entertained no
doubt that the opportunity for restitution had come, and he had an
overpowering impulse towards the penitential expression by which he
was deprecating chastisement.</p>
<p>“Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he
continued.</p>
<p>“No; she never liked to speak of them. She was a very generous,
honorable woman,” said Will, almost angrily.</p>
<p>“I do not wish to allege anything against her. Did she never
mention her mother to you at all?”</p>
<p>“I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know
the reason of her running away. She said ’poor mother’ in a pitying
tone.”</p>
<p>“That mother became my wife,” said Bulstrode, and then paused a
moment before he added, “you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I
said before, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience
recognizes. I was enriched by that marriage—a result which would
probably not have taken place—certainly not to the same extent—if
your grandmother could have discovered her daughter. That daughter,
I gather, is no longer living!”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so
strongly within him, that without quite knowing what he did, he
took his hat from the floor and stood up. The impulse within him
was to reject the disclosed connection.</p>
<p>“Pray be seated, Mr. Ladislaw,” said Bulstrode, anxiously.
“Doubtless you are startled by the suddenness of this discovery.
But I entreat your patience with one who is already bowed down by
inward trial.”</p>
<p>Will reseated himself, feeling some pity which was half contempt
for this voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man.</p>
<p>“It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation
which befell your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and
I wish to supply you adequately from a store which would have
probably already been yours had your grandmother been certain of
your mother’s existence and been able to find her.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode paused. He felt that he was performing a striking
piece of scrupulosity in the judgment of his auditor, and a
penitential act in the eyes of God. He had no clew to the state of
Will Ladislaw’s mind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of
Raffles, and with its natural quickness in construction stimulated
by the expectation of discoveries which he would have been glad to
conjure back into darkness. Will made no answer for several
moments, till Mr. Bulstrode, who at the end of his speech had cast
his eyes on the floor, now raised them with an examining glance,
which Will met fully, saying—</p>
<p>“I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where
she might have been found.”</p>
<p>Bulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and
hands. He was totally unprepared to have his advances met in this
way, or to find himself urged into more revelation than he had
beforehand set down as needful. But at that moment he dared not
tell a lie, and he felt suddenly uncertain of his ground which he
had trodden with some confidence before.</p>
<p>“I will not deny that you conjecture rightly,” he answered, with
a faltering in his tone. “And I wish to make atonement to you as
the one still remaining who has suffered a loss through me. You
enter, I trust, into my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a
reference to higher than merely human claims, and as I have already
said, is entirely independent of any legal compulsion. I am ready
to narrow my own resources and the prospects of my family by
binding myself to allow you five hundred pounds yearly during my
life, and to leave you a proportional capital at my death—nay, to
do still more, if more should be definitely necessary to any
laudable project on your part.” Mr. Bulstrode had gone on to
particulars in the expectation that these would work strongly on
Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful acceptance.</p>
<p>But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his lip
pouting and his fingers in his side-pockets. He was not in the
least touched, and said firmly,—</p>
<p>“Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I
must beg you to answer a question or two. Were you connected with
the business by which that fortune you speak of was originally
made?”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was, “Raffles has told him.” How could
he refuse to answer when he had volunteered what drew forth the
question? He answered, “Yes.“</p>
<p>“And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonorable
one—nay, one that, if its nature had been made public, might have
ranked those concerned in it with thieves and convicts?”</p>
<p>Will’s tone had a cutting bitterness: he was moved to put his
question as nakedly as he could.</p>
<p>Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He had been
prepared for a scene of self-abasement, but his intense pride and
his habit of supremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when
this young man, whom he had meant to benefit, turned on him with
the air of a judge.</p>
<p>“The business was established before I became connected with it,
sir; nor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,” he
answered, not raising his voice, but speaking with quick
defiantness.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is,” said Will, starting up again with his hat in his
hand. “It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to
decide whether I will have transactions with you and accept your
money. My unblemished honor is important to me. It is important to
me to have no stain on my birth and connections. And now I find
there is a stain which I can’t help. My mother felt it, and tried
to keep as clear of it as she could, and so will I. You shall keep
your ill-gotten money. If I had any fortune of my own, I would
willingly pay it to any one who could disprove what you have told
me. What I have to thank you for is that you kept the money till
now, when I can refuse it. It ought to lie with a man’s self that
he is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.”</p>
<p>Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined
quickness, was out of the room in an instant, and in another the
hall-door had closed behind him. He was too strongly possessed with
passionate rebellion against this inherited blot which had been
thrust on his knowledge to reflect at present whether he had not
been too hard on Bulstrode—too arrogantly merciless towards a man
of sixty, who was making efforts at retrieval when time had
rendered them vain.</p>
<p>No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the
impetuosity of Will’s repulse or the bitterness of his words. No
one but himself then knew how everything connected with the
sentiment of his own dignity had an immediate bearing for him on
his relation to Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon’s treatment of him.
And in the rush of impulses by which he flung back that offer of
Bulstrode’s there was mingled the sense that it would have been
impossible for him ever to tell Dorothea that he had accepted
it.</p>
<p>As for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent
reaction, and wept like a woman. It was the first time he had
encountered an open expression of scorn from any man higher than
Raffles; and with that scorn hurrying like venom through his
system, there was no sensibility left to consolations. Rut the
relief of weeping had to be checked. His wife and daughters soon
came home from hearing the address of an Oriental missionary, and
were full of regret that papa had not heard, in the first instance,
the interesting things which they tried to repeat to him.</p>
