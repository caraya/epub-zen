<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">D</span>orothea's distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly
from the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak
to his cousin, and that Will's presence at church had served to
mark more strongly the alienation between them. Will's coming
seemed to her quite excusable, nay, she thought it an amiable
movement in him towards a reconciliation which she herself had been
constantly wishing for. He had probably imagined, as she had, that
if Mr. Casaubon and he could meet easily, they would shake hands
and friendly intercourse might return. But now Dorothea felt quite
robbed of that hope. Will was banished further than ever, for Mr.
Casaubon must have been newly embittered by this thrusting upon him
of a presence which he refused to recognize.</p>
<p>He had not been very well that morning, suffering from some
difficulty in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she
was not surprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at
luncheon, still less that he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For
her own part she felt that she could never again introduce that
subject. They usually spent apart the hours between luncheon and
dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon in the library dozing chiefly, and
Dorothea in her boudoir, where she was wont to occupy herself with
some of her favorite books. There was a little heap of them on the
table in the bow-window—of various sorts, from Herodotus, which she
was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to her old companion
Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day opened one after
another, and could read none of them. Everything seemed dreary: the
portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish antiquities—oh
dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite hymns—all alike
were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring flowers and
the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon clouds that
hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which had become
habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future days in
which she would still live with them for her sole companions. It
was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor
Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the
perpetual effort demanded by her married life. She was always
trying to be what her husband wished, and never able to repose on
his delight in what she was. The thing that she liked, that she
spontaneously cared to have, seemed to be always excluded from her
life; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband it
might as well have been denied. About Will Ladislaw there had been
a difference between them from the first, and it had ended, since
Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed Dorothea’s strong feeling
about his claims on the family property, by her being convinced
that she was in the right and her husband in the wrong, but that
she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was more
wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could be
dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work
which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain,
and now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual
tomb, where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing
what would never see the light. Today she had stood at the door of
the tomb and seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of
warm activity and fellowship—turning his face towards her as he
went.</p>
<p>Books were of no use. Thinking was of no use. It was Sunday, and
she could not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had
a baby. There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and
discontent, and Dorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would
have borne a headache.</p>
<p>After dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud,
Mr. Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where,
he said, he had ordered a fire and lights. He seemed to have
revived, and to be thinking intently.</p>
<p>In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a
row of his note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into
her hand a well-known volume, which was a table of contents to all
the others.</p>
<p>“You will oblige me, my dear,” he said, seating himself, “if
instead of other reading this evening, you will go through this
aloud, pencil in hand, and at each point where I say ’mark,’ will
make a cross with your pencil. This is the first step in a sifting
process which I have long had in view, and as we go on I shall be
able to indicate to you certain principles of selection whereby you
will, I trust, have an intelligent participation in my
purpose.”</p>
<p>This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his
memorable interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original
reluctance to let Dorothea work with him had given place to the
contrary disposition, namely, to demand much interest and labor
from her.</p>
<p>After she had read and marked for two hours, he said, “We will
take the volume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case
of reading in the night, we can pursue this task. It is not
wearisome to you, I trust, Dorothea?”</p>
<p>“I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said
Dorothea, who told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to
exert herself in reading or anything else which left him as joyless
as ever.</p>
<p>It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics
in Dorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all
his jealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the
integrity of her promises, and her power of devoting herself to her
idea of the right and best. Of late he had begun to feel that these
qualities were a peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to
engross them.</p>
<p>The reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her young
weariness had slept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of
light, which seemed to her at first like a sudden vision of sunset
after she had climbed a steep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her
husband wrapped in his warm gown seating himself in the arm-chair
near the fire-place where the embers were still glowing. He had lit
two candles, expecting that Dorothea would awake, but not liking to
rouse her by more direct means.</p>
<p>“Are you ill, Edward?” she said, rising immediately.</p>
<p>“I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here
for a time.” She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and
said, “You would like me to read to you?”</p>
<p>“You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,” said Mr.
Casaubon, with a shade more meekness than usual in his polite
manner. “I am wakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.”</p>
<p>“I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,” said
Dorothea, remembering Lydgate’s cautions.</p>
<p>“No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.”
Dorothea dared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the
same plan as she had done in the evening, but getting over the
pages with more quickness. Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and
he seemed to anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal
indication, saying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the
next head—I omit the second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed
to think of the bird-like speed with which his mind was surveying
the ground where it had been creeping for years. At last he
said—</p>
<p>“Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow.
I have deferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But
you observe that the principle on which my selection is made, is to
give adequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the
theses enumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You
have perceived that distinctly, Dorothea?”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She felt sick at
heart.</p>
<p>“And now I think that I can take some repose,” said Mr.
Casaubon. He laid down again and begged her to put out the lights.
When she had lain down too, and there was a darkness only broken by
a dull glow on the hearth, he said—</p>
<p>“Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.</p>
<p>“It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case
of my death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid
doing what I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I
should desire.”</p>
<p>Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been
leading her to the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s
part which might make a new yoke for her. She did not answer
immediately.</p>
<p>“You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.</p>
<p>“No, I do not yet refuse,” said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the
need of freedom asserting itself within her; “but it is too
solemn—I think it is not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant
what it will bind me to. Whatever affection prompted I would do
without promising.”</p>
<p>“But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine;
you refuse.”</p>
<p>“No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing
fears. “But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my
whole soul to do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any
pledge suddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.”</p>
<p>“You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?”</p>
<p>“Grant me till to-morrow,” said Dorothea, beseechingly.</p>
<p>“Till to-morrow then,” said Mr. Casaubon.</p>
<p>Soon she could hear that he was sleeping, but there was no more
sleep for her. While she constrained herself to lie still lest she
should disturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which
imagination ranged its forces first on one side and then on the
other. She had no presentiment that the power which her husband
wished to establish over her future action had relation to anything
else than his work. But it was clear enough to her that he would
expect her to devote herself to sifting those mixed heaps of
material, which were to be the doubtful illustration of principles
still more doubtful. The poor child had become altogether
unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key which had made
the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life. It was not
wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in
this matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed
comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had
risked all his egoism. And now she pictured to herself the days,
and months, and years which she must spend in sorting what might be
called shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was
itself a mosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for
a theory which was already withered in the birth like an elfin
child. Doubtless a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the
embryos of truth a-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same
time a questioning of substances, the body of chemistry is prepared
for its soul, and Lavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of
the elements which made the seed of all tradition was not likely to
bruise itself unawares against discoveries: it floated among
flexible conjectures no more solid than those etymologies which
seemed strong because of likeness in sound until it was shown that
likeness in sound made them impossible: it was a method of
interpretation which was not tested by the necessity of forming
anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate notion of
Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for
threading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to
check her weariness and impatience over this questionable
riddle-guessing, as it revealed itself to her instead of the
fellowship in high knowledge which was to make life worthier! She
could understand well enough now why her husband had come to cling
to her, as possibly the only hope left that his labors would ever
take a shape in which they could be given to the world. At first it
had seemed that he wished to keep even her aloof from any close
knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually the terrible
stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy death—</p>
<p>And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her
husband’s past—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which
had grown out of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition
breathing hardly under the pressure of self-distrust; the goal
receding, and the heavier limbs; and now at last the sword visibly
trembling above him! And had she not wished to marry him that she
might help him in his life’s labor?—But she had thought the work
was to be something greater, which she could serve in devoutly for
its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his grief—would it be
possible, even if she promised—to work as in a treadmill
fruitlessly?</p>
<p>And yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content
this pining hunger?” It would be refusing to do for him dead, what
she was almost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate
had said he might, for fifteen years or more, her life would
certainly be spent in helping him and obeying him.</p>
<p>Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the
living and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While
he lived, he could claim nothing that she would not still be free
to remonstrate against, and even to refuse. But—the thought passed
through her mind more than once, though she could not believe in
it—might he not mean to demand something more from her than she had
been able to imagine, since he wanted her pledge to carry out his
wishes without telling her exactly what they were? No; his heart
was bound up in his work only: that was the end for which his
failing life was to be eked out by hers.</p>
<p>And now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no
finger to your work”—it seemed as if she would be crushing that
bruised heart.</p>
<p>For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill
and bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a
child which has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late
morning sleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up.
Tantripp told her that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in
the library.</p>
<p>“I never saw you look so pale, madam,” said Tantripp, a
solid-figured woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.</p>
<p>“Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?” said Dorothea, smiling
faintly.</p>
<p>“Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny
rose. But always smelling those leather books, what can be
expected? Do rest a little this morning, madam. Let me say you are
ill and not able to go into that close library.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, no! let me make haste,” said Dorothea. “Mr. Casaubon
wants me particularly.”</p>
<p>When she went down she felt sure that she should promise to
fulfil his wishes; but that would be later in the day—not yet.</p>
<p>As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from
the table where he had been placing some books, and said—</p>
<p>“I was waiting for your appearance, my dear. I had hoped to set
to work at once this morning, but I find myself under some
indisposition, probably from too much excitement yesterday. I am
going now to take a turn in the shrubbery, since the air is
milder.”</p>
<p>“I am glad to hear that,” said Dorothea. “Your mind, I feared,
was too active last night.”</p>
<p>“I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,
Dorothea. You can now, I hope, give me an answer.”</p>
<p>“May I come out to you in the garden presently?” said Dorothea,
winning a little breathing space in that way.</p>
<p>“I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,” said
Mr. Casaubon, and then he left her.</p>
<p>Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring
her some wraps. She had been sitting still for a few minutes, but
not in any renewal of the former conflict: she simply felt that she
was going to say “Yes“ to her own doom: she was too weak, too full
of dread at the thought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her
husband, to do anything but submit completely. She sat still and
let Tantripp put on her bonnet and shawl, a passivity which was
unusual with her, for she liked to wait on herself.</p>
<p>“God bless you, madam!” said Tantripp, with an irrepressible
movement of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom
she felt unable to do anything more, now that she had finished
tying the bonnet.</p>
<p>This was too much for Dorothea’s highly-strung feeling, and she
burst into tears, sobbing against Tantripp’s arm. But soon she
checked herself, dried her eyes, and went out at the glass door
into the shrubbery.</p>
<p>“I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for
your master,” said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him in
the breakfast-room. She had been at Rome, and visited the
antiquities, as we know; and she always declined to call Mr.
Casaubon anything but “your master,” when speaking to the other
servants.</p>
<p>Pratt laughed. He liked his master very well, but he liked
Tantripp better.</p>
<p>When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she lingered among
the nearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once
before, though from a different cause. Then she had feared lest her
effort at fellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to
the spot where she foresaw that she must bind herself to a
fellowship from which she shrank. Neither law nor the world’s
opinion compelled her to this—only her husband’s nature and her own
compassion, only the ideal and not the real yoke of marriage. She
saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet she was fettered: she
could not smite the stricken soul that entreated hers. If that were
weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was passing, and she
must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree Walk she could
not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she went,
expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak,
which, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment on chill days
for the garden. It occurred to her that he might be resting in the
summer-house, towards which the path diverged a little. Turning the
angle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone
table. His arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed
down on them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening
his face on each side.</p>
<p>“He exhausted himself last night,” Dorothea said to herself,
thinking at first that he was asleep, and that the summer-house was
too damp a place to rest in. But then she remembered that of late
she had seen him take that attitude when she was reading to him, as
if he found it easier than any other; and that he would sometimes
speak, as well as listen, with his face down in that way. She went
into the summerhouse and said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”</p>
<p>He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep.
She laid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!”
Still he was motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she
leaned down to him, took off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek
close to his head, crying in a distressed tone—</p>
<p>“Wake, dear, wake! Listen to me. I am come to answer.” But
Dorothea never gave her answer.</p>
<p>Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was
talking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone
through her mind the night before. She knew him, and called him by
his name, but appeared to think it right that she should explain
everything to him; and again, and again, begged him to explain
everything to her husband.</p>
<p>“Tell him I shall go to him soon: I am ready to promise. Only,
thinking about it was so dreadful—it has made me ill. Not very ill.
I shall soon be better. Go and tell him.”</p>
<p>But the silence in her husband’s ear was never more to be
broken.</p>
