<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">E</span>xiles notoriously feed much on hopes, and are unlikely to stay
in banishment unless they are obliged. When Will Ladislaw exiled
himself from Middlemarch he had placed no stronger obstacle to his
return than his own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier,
but simply a state of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other
states of mind, and to find itself bowing, smiling, and giving
place with polite facility. As the months went on, it had seemed
more and more difficult to him to say why he should not run down to
Middlemarch—merely for the sake of hearing something about
Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit he should chance by some
strange coincidence to meet with her, there was no reason for him
to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey which he had
beforehand supposed that he should not take. Since he was
hopelessly divided from her, he might surely venture into her
neighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon
watch over her—their opinions seemed less and less important with
time and change of air.</p>
<p>And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea,
which seemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of
philanthropic duty. Will had given a disinterested attention to an
intended settlement on a new plan in the Far West, and the need for
funds in order to carry out a good design had set him on debating
with himself whether it would not be a laudable use to make of his
claim on Bulstrode, to urge the application of that money which had
been offered to himself as a means of carrying out a scheme likely
to be largely beneficial. The question seemed a very dubious one to
Will, and his repugnance to again entering into any relation with
the banker might have made him dismiss it quickly, if there had not
arisen in his imagination the probability that his judgment might
be more safely determined by a visit to Middlemarch.</p>
<p>That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for
coming down. He had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the
money question with him, and he had meant to amuse himself for the
few evenings of his stay by having a great deal of music and
badinage with fair Rosamond, without neglecting his friends at
Lowick Parsonage:—if the Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was
no fault of his. He had neglected the Farebrothers before his
departure, from a proud resistance to the possible accusation of
indirectly seeking interviews with Dorothea; but hunger tames us,
and Will had become very hungry for the vision of a certain form
and the sound of a certain voice. Nothing, had done instead—not the
opera, or the converse of zealous politicians, or the flattering
reception (in dim corners) of his new hand in leading articles.</p>
<p>Thus he had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost
everything would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed,
that there would be no surprises in his visit. But he had found
that humdrum world in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even
badinage and lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of this
visit had become the most fatal epoch of his life. The next morning
he felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences—he dreaded
so much the immediate issues before him—that seeing while he
breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach, he went out
hurriedly and took his place on it, that he might be relieved, at
least for a day, from the necessity of doing or saying anything in
Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which
are commoner in experience than one might imagine, from the shallow
absoluteness of men’s judgments. He had found Lydgate, for whom he
had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which claimed his
thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why, in
spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have
avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was
precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a
creature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral
region of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that
befell him into the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation
that Rosamond had made her happiness in any way dependent on him
was a difficulty which his outburst of rage towards her had
immeasurably increased for him. He hated his own cruelty, and yet
he dreaded to show the fulness of his relenting: he must go to her
again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her
unhappiness was a power which he dreaded. And all the while there
was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before him than if
his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his fresh start on
crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should not get on
the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note to
Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But
there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt
departure: the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the
crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the
acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for
him to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance
which was also despair.</p>
<p>Thus he did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston
coach. He came back again by it while it was still daylight, having
made up his mind that he must go to Lydgate’s that evening. The
Rubicon, we know, was a very insignificant stream to look at; its
significance lay entirely in certain invisible conditions. Will
felt as if he were forced to cross his small boundary ditch, and
what he saw beyond it was not empire, but discontented
subjection.</p>
<p>But it is given to us sometimes even in our every-day life to
witness the saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy
of rescue that may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship. If
Dorothea, after her night’s anguish, had not taken that walk to
Rosamond—why, she perhaps would have been a woman who gained a
higher character for discretion, but it would certainly not have
been as well for those three who were on one hearth in Lydgate’s
house at half-past seven that evening.</p>
<p>Rosamond had been prepared for Will’s visit, and she received
him with a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her
nervous exhaustion, of which he could not suppose that it had any
relation to Will. And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of
work, he innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by
begging her to lean backward and rest. Will was miserable in the
necessity for playing the part of a friend who was making his first
appearance and greeting to Rosamond, while his thoughts were busy
about her feeling since that scene of yesterday, which seemed still
inexorably to enclose them both, like the painful vision of a
double madness. It happened that nothing called Lydgate out of the
room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea, and Will came near to
fetch it, she placed a tiny bit of folded paper in his saucer. He
saw it and secured it quickly, but as he went back to his inn he
had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had written to
him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the evening.
Still, he opened and read it by his bed-candle. There were only
these few words in her neatly flowing hand:—</p>
<p>“I have told Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about
you. I told her because she came to see me and was very kind. You
will have nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made
any difference to you.”</p>
<p>The effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will
dwelt on them with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears
burning at the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and
Rosamond—at the uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her
dignity wounded in having an explanation of his conduct offered to
her. There might still remain in her mind a changed association
with him which made an irremediable difference—a lasting flaw. With
active fancy he wrought himself into a state of doubt little more
easy than that of the man who has escaped from wreck by night and
stands on unknown ground in the darkness. Until that wretched
yesterday—except the moment of vexation long ago in the very same
room and in the very same presence—all their vision, all their
thought of each other, had been as in a world apart, where the
sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and no
other soul entered. But now—would Dorothea meet him in that world
again?</p>
