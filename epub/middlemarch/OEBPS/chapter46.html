<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hile Lydgate, safely married and with the Hospital under his
command, felt himself struggling for Medical Reform against
Middlemarch, Middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of
the national struggle for another kind of Reform.</p>
<p>By the time that Lord John Russell’s measure was being debated
in the House of Commons, there was a new political animation in
Middlemarch, and a new definition of parties which might show a
decided change of balance if a new election came. And there were
some who already predicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill
would never be carried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will
Ladislaw dwelt on to Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that
he had not yet tried his strength at the hustings.</p>
<p>“Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,” said
Will. “The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the
question of Reform has set in. There is likely to be another
election before long, and by that time Middlemarch will have got
more ideas into its head. What we have to work at now is the
’Pioneer’ and political meetings.”</p>
<p>“Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion
here,” said Mr. Brooke. “Only I want to keep myself independent
about Reform, you know; I don’t want to go too far. I want to take
up. Wilberforce’s and Romilly’s line, you know, and work at Negro
Emancipation, Criminal Law—that kind of thing. But of course I
should support Grey.”</p>
<p>“If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared
to take what the situation offers,” said Will. “If everybody pulled
for his own bit against everybody else, the whole question would go
to tatters.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I agree with you—I quite take that point of view. I
should put it in that light. I should support Grey, you know. But I
don’t want to change the balance of the constitution, and I don’t
think Grey would.”</p>
<p>“But that is what the country wants,”-said Will. “Else there
would be no meaning in political unions or any other movement that
knows what it’s about. It wants to have a House of Commons which is
not weighted with nominees of the landed class, but with
representatives of the other interests. And as to contending for a
reform short of that, it is like asking for a bit of an avalanche
which has already begun to thunder.”</p>
<p>“That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it. Write that
down, now. We must begin to get documents about the feeling of the
country, as well as the machine-breaking and general distress.”</p>
<p>“As to documents,” said Will, “a two-inch card will hold plenty.
A few rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few
more will show the rate at which the political determination of the
people is growing.”</p>
<p>“Good: draw that out a little more at length, Ladislaw. That is
an idea, now: write it out in the ’Pioneer.’ Put the figures and
deduce the misery, you know; and put the other figures and
deduce—and so on. You have a way of putting things. Burke,
now:—when I think of Burke, I can’t help wishing somebody had a
pocket-borough to give you, Ladislaw. You’d never get elected, you
know. And we shall always want talent in the House: reform as we
will, we shall always want talent. That avalanche and the thunder,
now, was really a little like Burke. I want that sort of thing—not
ideas, you know, but a way of putting them.”</p>
<p>“Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,” said Ladislaw, “if they
were always in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at
hand.”</p>
<p>Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even
from Mr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be
conscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to
have it noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the
right thing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time
is rather fortifying. Will felt that his literary refinements were
usually beyond the limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless,
he was beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began
he had said to himself rather languidly, “Why not?”—and he studied
the political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever
given to poetic metres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but
for the desire to be where Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of
knowing what else to do, Will would not at this time have been
meditating on the needs of the English people or criticising
English statesmanship: he would probably have been rambling in
Italy sketching plans for several dramas, trying prose and finding
it too jejune, trying verse and finding it too artificial,
beginning to copy “bits“ from old pictures, leaving off because
they were ”no good,“ and observing that, after all, self-culture
was the principal point; while in politics he would have been
sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our sense
of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of
dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is
not a matter of indifference.</p>
<p>Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not
that indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as
alone worthy of continuous effort. His nature warmed easily in the
presence of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action,
and the easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public
spirit. In spite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he
was rather happy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a
vivid way and for practical purposes, and making the “Pioneer“
celebrated as far as Brassing (never mind the smallness of the
area; the writing was not worse than much that reaches the four
corners of the earth).</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will’s impatience
was relieved by the division of his time between visits to the
Grange and retreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety
to his life.</p>
<p>“Shift the pegs a little,” he said to himself, “and Mr. Brooke
might be in the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the
common order of things: the little waves make the large ones and
are of the same pattern. I am better here than in the sort of life
Mr. Casaubon would have trained me for, where the doing would be
all laid down by a precedent too rigid for me to react upon. I
don’t care for prestige or high pay.”</p>
<p>As Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather
enjoying the sense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of
romance in his position, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a
little surprise wherever he went. That sort of enjoyment had been
disturbed when he had felt some new distance between himself and
Dorothea in their accidental meeting at Lydgate’s, and his
irritation had gone out towards Mr. Casaubon, who had declared
beforehand that Will would lose caste. “I never had any caste,” he
would have said, if that prophecy had been uttered to him, and the
quick blood would have come and gone like breath in his transparent
skin. But it is one thing to like defiance, and another thing to
like its consequences.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the
“Pioneer“ was tending to confirm Mr. Casaubon’s view. Will’s
relationship in that distinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate’s
high connections, serve as an advantageous introduction: if it was
rumored that young Ladislaw was Mr. Casaubon’s nephew or cousin, it
was also rumored that ”Mr. Casaubon would have nothing to do with
him.“</p>
<p>“Brooke has taken him up,” said Mr. Hawley, “because that is
what no man in his senses could have expected. Casaubon has
devilish good reasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold
shoulder on a young fellow whose bringing-up he paid for. Just like
Brooke—one of those fellows who would praise a cat to sell a
horse.”</p>
<p>And some oddities of Will’s, more or less poetical, appeared to
support Mr. Keck, the editor of the “Trumpet,“ in asserting that
Ladislaw, if the truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary
but crack-brained, which accounted for the preternatural quickness
and glibness of his speech when he got on to a platform—as he did
whenever he had an opportunity, speaking with a facility which cast
reflections on solid Englishmen generally. It was disgusting to
Keck to see a strip of a fellow, with light curls round his head,
get up and speechify by the hour against institutions ”which had
existed when he was in his cradle.“ And in a leading article of the
”Trumpet,” Keck characterized Ladislaw’s speech at a Reform meeting
as “the violence of an energumen—a miserable effort to shroud in
the brilliancy of fireworks the daring of irresponsible statements
and the poverty of a knowledge which was of the cheapest and most
recent description.”</p>
<p>“That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,” said Dr. Sprague,
with sarcastic intentions. “But what is an energumen?”</p>
<p>“Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,” said
Keck.</p>
<p>This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with
other habits which became matter of remark. He had a fondness, half
artistic, half affectionate, for little children—the smaller they
were on tolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the
better Will liked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome
he was given to ramble about among the poor people, and the taste
did not quit him in Middlemarch.</p>
<p>He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little
hatless boys with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting
to hang out, little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes
to look at him, and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven.
This troop he had led out on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at
nutting-time, and since the cold weather had set in he had taken
them on a clear day to gather sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of
a hillside, where he drew out a small feast of gingerbread for
them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy drama with some private
home-made puppets. Here was one oddity. Another was, that in houses
where he got friendly, he was given to stretch himself at full
length on the rug while he talked, and was apt to be discovered in
this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an irregularity
was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed blood
and general laxity.</p>
<p>But Will’s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in
families which the new strictness of party division had marked off
on the side of Reform. He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode’s; but here
he could not lie down on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his
mode of talking about Catholic countries, as if there were any
truce with Antichrist, illustrated the usual tendency to
unsoundness in intellectual men.</p>
<p>At Mr. Farebrother’s, however, whom the irony of events had
brought on the same side with Bulstrode in the national movement,
Will became a favorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss
Noble, whom it was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in
the street with her little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes
of the town, and insisting on going with her to pay some call where
she distributed her small filchings from her own share of sweet
things.</p>
<p>But the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug
was Lydgate’s. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed
none the worse. Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little
notice of megrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually
throw away his susceptibilities on those who took no notice of
them. With Rosamond, on the other hand, he pouted and was
wayward—nay, often uncomplimentary, much to her inward surprise;
nevertheless he was gradually becoming necessary to her
entertainment by his companionship in her music, his varied talk,
and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which, with all her
husband’s tenderness and indulgence, often made his manners
unsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike of the medical
profession.</p>
<p>Lydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of
the people in the efficacy of “the bill,” while nobody cared about
the low state of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with
troublesome questions. One evening in March, Rosamond in her
cherry-colored dress with swansdown trimming about the throat sat
at the tea-table; Lydgate, lately come in tired from his outdoor
work, was seated sideways on an easy-chair by the fire with one leg
over the elbow, his brow looking a little troubled as his eyes
rambled over the columns of the “Pioneer,“ while Rosamond, having
noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking at him, and inwardly
thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody disposition. Will
Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the curtain-pole
abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of ”When first I saw
thy face;“ while the house spaniel, also stretched out with small
choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of the
rug with silent but strong objection.</p>
<p>Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the
paper, and said to Will, who had started up and gone to the
table—</p>
<p>“It’s no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord,
Ladislaw: they only pick the more holes in his coat in the
’Trumpet.’”</p>
<p>“No matter; those who read the ’Pioneer’ don’t read the
’Trumpet,’” said Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do
you suppose the public reads with a view to its own conversion? We
should have a witches’ brewing with a vengeance then—’Mingle,
mingle, mingle, mingle, You that mingle may’—and nobody would know
which side he was going to take.”</p>
<p>“Farebrother says, he doesn’t believe Brooke would get elected
if the opportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him
would bring another member out of the bag at the right moment.”</p>
<p>“There’s no harm in trying. It’s good to have resident
members.”</p>
<p>“Why?“ said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient
word in a curt tone.</p>
<p>“They represent the local stupidity better,” said Will,
laughing, and shaking his curls; “and they are kept on their best
behavior in the neighborhood. Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he
has done some good things on his estate that he never would have
done but for this Parliamentary bite.”</p>
<p>“He’s not fitted to be a public man,” said Lydgate, with
contemptuous decision. “He would disappoint everybody who counted
on him: I can see that at the Hospital. Only, there Bulstrode holds
the reins and drives him.”</p>
<p>“That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,” said
Will. “He’s good enough for the occasion: when the people have made
up their mind as they are making it up now, they don’t want a
man—they only want a vote.”</p>
<p>“That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up
a measure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are
a part of the very disease that wants curing.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the
land without knowing it,” said Will, who could find reasons
impromptu, when he had not thought of a question beforehand.</p>
<p>“That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious
exaggeration of hopes about this particular measure, helping the
cry to swallow it whole and to send up voting popinjays who are
good for nothing but to carry it. You go against rottenness, and
there is nothing more thoroughly rotten than making people believe
that society can be cured by a political hocus-pocus.”</p>
<p>“That’s very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin
somewhere, and put it that a thousand things which debase a
population can never be reformed without this particular reform to
begin with. Look what Stanley said the other day—that the House had
been tinkering long enough at small questions of bribery, inquiring
whether this or that voter has had a guinea when everybody knows
that the seats have been sold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and
conscience in public agents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can
trust to is the massive sense of wrong in a class, and the best
wisdom that will work is the wisdom of balancing claims. That’s my
text—which side is injured? I support the man who supports their
claims; not the virtuous upholder of the wrong.”</p>
<p>“That general talk about a particular case is mere question
begging, Ladislaw. When I say, I go in for the dose that cures, it
doesn’t follow that I go in for opium in a given case of gout.”</p>
<p>“I am not begging the question we are upon—whether we are to try
for nothing till we find immaculate men to work with. Should you go
on that plan? If there were one man who would carry you a medical
reform and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which
had the better motives or even the better brains?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course,” said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a
move which he had often used himself, “if one did not work with
such men as are at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose
the worst opinion in the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that
would not make it less true that he has the sense and the
resolution to do what I think ought to be done in the matters I
know and care most about; but that is the only ground on which I go
with him,” Lydgate added rather proudly, bearing in mind Mr.
Farebrother’s remarks. “He is nothing to me otherwise; I would not
cry him up on any personal ground—I would keep clear of that.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?” said
Will Ladislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For the first time
he felt offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he
would have declined any close inquiry into the growth of his
relation to Mr. Brooke.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Lydgate, “I was simply explaining my own
action. I meant that a man may work for a special end with others
whose motives and general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure
of his personal independence, and that he is not working for his
private interest—either place or money.”</p>
<p>“Then, why don’t you extend your liberality to others?” said
Will, still nettled. “My personal independence is as important to
me as yours is to you. You have no more reason to imagine that I
have personal expectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that
you have personal expectations from Bulstrode. Motives are points
of honor, I suppose—nobody can prove them. But as to money and
place in the world.” Will ended, tossing back his head, “I think it
is pretty clear that I am not determined by considerations of that
sort.”</p>
<p>“You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,” said Lydgate, surprised. He
had been preoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind
to what Ladislaw might infer on his own account. “I beg your pardon
for unintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather
attribute to you a romantic disregard of your own worldly
interests. On the political question, I referred simply to
intellectual bias.”</p>
<p>“How very unpleasant you both are this evening!” said Rosamond.
“I cannot conceive why money should have been referred to. Polities
and Medicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon. You can
both of you go on quarrelling with all the world and with each
other on those two topics.”</p>
<p>Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring
the bell, and then crossing to her work-table.</p>
<p>“Poor Rosy!” said Lydgate, putting out his hand to her as she
was passing him. “Disputation is not amusing to cherubs. Have some
music. Ask Ladislaw to sing with you.”</p>
<p>When Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband, “What put you
out of temper this evening, Tertius?”</p>
<p>“Me? It was Ladislaw who was out of temper. He is like a bit of
tinder.”</p>
<p>“But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you
came in, you looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with
Mr. Ladislaw. You hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.”</p>
<p>“Do I? Then I am a brute,” said Lydgate, caressing her
penitently.</p>
<p>“What vexed you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, outdoor things—business.” It was really a letter insisting
on the payment of a bill for furniture. But Rosamond was expecting
to have a baby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any
perturbation.</p>
