<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">I</span> am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious
events at Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than
he had known in his life before. Not that he had been disappointed
as to the possible market for his horse, but that before the
bargain could be concluded with Lord Medlicote's man, this Diamond,
in which hope to the amount of eighty pounds had been invested, had
without the slightest warning exhibited in the stable a most
vicious energy in kicking, had just missed killing the groom, and
had ended in laming himself severely by catching his leg in a rope
that overhung the stable-board. There was no more redress for this
than for the discovery of bad temper after marriage—which of course
old companions were aware of before the ceremony. For some reason
or other, Fred had none of his usual elasticity under this stroke
of ill-fortune: he was simply aware that he had only fifty pounds,
that there was no chance of his getting any more at present, and
that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be presented in five
days. Even if he had applied to his father on the plea that Mr.
Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly that his
father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the
consequence of what he would call encouraging extravagance and
deceit. He was so utterly downcast that he could frame no other
project than to go straight to Mr. Garth and tell him the sad
truth, carrying with him the fifty pounds, and getting that sum at
least safely out of his own hands. His father, being at the
warehouse, did not yet know of the accident: when he did, he would
storm about the vicious brute being brought into his stable; and
before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred wanted to get away with
all his courage to face the greater. He took his father's nag, for
he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr. Garth, he would
ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary. In fact, it is
probable that but for Mary's existence and Fred's love for her, his
conscience would have been much less active both in previously
urging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare
himself after his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task,
but to act as directly and simply as he could. Even much stronger
mortals than Fred Vincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of
the being they love best. "The theatre of all my actions is
fallen," said an antique personage when his chief friend was dead;
and they are fortunate who get a theatre where the audience demands
their best. Certainly it would have made a considerable difference
to Fred at that time if Mary Garth had had no decided notions as to
what was admirable in character.</p>
<p>Mr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his house,
which was a little way outside the town—a homely place with an
orchard in front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered
building, which before the town had spread had been a farm-house,
but was now surrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen. We
get the fonder of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their
own, as our friends have. The Garth family, which was rather a
large one, for Mary had four brothers and one sister, were very
fond of their old house, from which all the best furniture had long
been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing it by heart even to the attic
which smelt deliciously of apples and quinces, and until to-day he
had never come to it without pleasant expectations; but his heart
beat uneasily now with the sense that he should probably have to
make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom he was rather more
in awe than of her husband. Not that she was inclined to sarcasm
and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her present matronly age
at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by over-hasty speech;
having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth, and learned
self-control. She had that rare sense which discerns what is
unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her
husband’s virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his
incapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the
consequences cheerfully. She had been magnanimous enough to
renounce all pride in teapots or children’s frilling, and had never
poured any pathetic confidences into the ears of her feminine
neighbors concerning Mr. Garth’s want of prudence and the sums he
might have had if he had been like other men. Hence these fair
neighbors thought her either proud or eccentric, and sometimes
spoke of her to their husbands as “your fine Mrs. Garth.” She was
not without her criticism of them in return, being more accurately
instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and—where is the
blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex,
which in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the
other hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the
failings of men, and was often heard to say that these were
natural. Also, it must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too
emphatic in her resistance to what she held to be follies: the
passage from governess into housewife had wrought itself a little
too strongly into her consciousness, and she rarely forgot that
while her grammar and accent were above the town standard, she wore
a plain cap, cooked the family dinner, and darned all the
stockings. She had sometimes taken pupils in a peripatetic fashion,
making them follow her about in the kitchen with their book or
slate. She thought it good for them to see that she could make an
excellent lather while she corrected their blunders “without
looking,“—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows
might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone—that,
in short, she might possess ”education” and other good things
ending in “tion,“ and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without
being a useless doll. When she made remarks to this edifying
effect, she had a firm little frown on her brow, which yet did not
hinder her face from looking benevolent, and her words which came
forth like a procession were uttered in a fervid agreeable
contralto. Certainly, the exemplary Mrs. Garth had her droll
aspects, but her character sustained her oddities, as a very fine
wine sustains a flavor of skin.</p>
<p>Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always
been disposed to excuse his errors, though she would probably not
have excused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being
included in that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her
own sex. But this very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards
him made it the harder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in
her opinion. And the circumstances of his visit turned out to be
still more unpleasant than he had expected; for Caleb Garth had
gone out early to look at some repairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at
certain hours was always in the kitchen, and this morning she was
carrying on several occupations at once there—making her pies at
the well-scoured deal table on one side of that airy room,
observing Sally’s movements at the oven and dough-tub through an
open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy and girl, who
were standing opposite to her at the table with their books and
slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other end of
the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also
going on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garth, with her sleeves turned above her elbows, deftly
handling her pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental
pinches, while she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the
right views about the concord of verbs and pronouns with “nouns of
multitude or signifying many,” was a sight agreeably amusing. She
was of the same curly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but
handsomer, with more delicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid
matronly figure, and a remarkable firmness of glance. In her
snowy-frilled cap she reminded one of that delightful Frenchwoman
whom we have all seen marketing, basket on arm. Looking at the
mother, you might hope that the daughter would become like her,
which is a prospective advantage equal to a dowry—the mother too
often standing behind the daughter like a malignant prophecy—“Such
as I am, she will shortly be.”</p>
<p>“Now let us go through that once more,” said Mrs. Garth,
pinching an apple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic
young male with a heavy brow, from due attention to the lesson.
“’Not without regard to the import of the word as conveying unity
or plurality of idea’—tell me again what that means, Ben.”</p>
<p>(Mrs. Garth, like more celebrated educators, had her favorite
ancient paths, and in a general wreck of society would have tried
to hold her “Lindley Murray” above the waves.)</p>
<p>“Oh—it means—you must think what you mean,” said Ben, rather
peevishly. “I hate grammar. What’s the use of it?”</p>
<p>“To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be
understood,” said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. “Should you
like to speak as old Job does?”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Ben, stoutly; ”it’s funnier. He says, ’Yo
goo’—that’s just as good as ’You go.’“</p>
<p>“But he says, ’A ship’s in the garden,’ instead of ’a sheep,’”
said Letty, with an air of superiority. “You might think he meant a
ship off the sea.”</p>
<p>“No, you mightn’t, if you weren’t silly,” said Ben. “How could a
ship off the sea come there?”</p>
<p>“These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least
part of grammar,” said Mrs. Garth. “That apple-peel is to be eaten
by the pigs, Ben; if you eat it, I must give them your piece of
pasty. Job has only to speak about very plain things. How do you
think you would write or speak about anything more difficult, if
you knew no more of grammar than he does? You would use wrong
words, and put words in the wrong places, and instead of making
people understand you, they would turn away from you as a tiresome
person. What would you do then?”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t care, I should leave off,” said Ben, with a sense
that this was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned.</p>
<p>“I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,” said Mrs. Garth,
accustomed to these obstructive arguments from her male offspring.
Having finished her pies, she moved towards the clothes-horse, and
said, “Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday,
about Cincinnatus.”</p>
<p>“I know! he was a farmer,” said Ben.</p>
<p>“Now, Ben, he was a Roman—let <i>me</i> tell," said Letty, using
her elbow contentiously.</p>
<p>“You silly thing, he was a Roman farmer, and he was
ploughing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but before that—that didn’t come first—people wanted him,”
said Letty.</p>
<p>“Well, but you must say what sort of a man he was first,”
insisted Ben. “He was a wise man, like my father, and that made the
people want his advice. And he was a brave man, and could fight.
And so could my father—couldn’t he, mother?”</p>
<p>“Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it
us,” said Letty, frowning. “Please, mother, tell Ben not to
speak.”</p>
<p>“Letty, I am ashamed of you,” said her mother, wringing out the
caps from the tub. “When your brother began, you ought to have
waited to see if he could not tell the story. How rude you look,
pushing and frowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows!
Cincinnatus, I am sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter
behave so.” (Mrs. Garth delivered this awful sentence with much
majesty of enunciation, and Letty felt that between repressed
volubility and general disesteem, that of the Romans inclusive,
life was already a painful affair.) “Now, Ben.”</p>
<p>“Well—oh—well—why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they
were all blockheads, and—I can’t tell it just how you told it—but
they wanted a man to be captain and king and everything—”</p>
<p>“Dictator, now,” said Letty, with injured looks, and not without
a wish to make her mother repent.</p>
<p>“Very well, dictator!” said Ben, contemptuously. “But that isn’t
a good word: he didn’t tell them to write on slates.”</p>
<p>“Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that,” said Mrs.
Garth, carefully serious. “Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run,
Letty, and open it.”</p>
<p>The knock was Fred’s; and when Letty said that her father was
not in yet, but that her mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no
alternative. He could not depart from his usual practice of going
to see Mrs. Garth in the kitchen if she happened to be at work
there. He put his arm round Letty’s neck silently, and led her into
the kitchen without his usual jokes and caresses.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise
was not a feeling that she was given to express, and she only said,
quietly continuing her work—</p>
<p>“You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has
anything happened?”</p>
<p>“I want to speak to Mr. Garth,” said Fred, not yet ready to say
more—“and to you also,” he added, after a little pause, for he had
no doubt that Mrs. Garth knew everything about the bill, and he
must in the end speak of it before her, if not to her solely.</p>
<p>“Caleb will be in again in a few minutes,” said Mrs. Garth, who
imagined some trouble between Fred and his father. “He is sure not
to be long, because he has some work at his desk that must be done
this morning. Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my
matters here?”</p>
<p>“But we needn’t go on about Cincinnatus, need we?” said Ben, who
had taken Fred’s whip out of his hand, and was trying its
efficiency on the cat.</p>
<p>“No, go out now. But put that whip down. How very mean of you to
whip poor old Tortoise! Pray take the whip from him, Fred.”</p>
<p>“Come, old boy, give it me,” said Fred, putting out his
hand.</p>
<p>“Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?” said Ben, rendering
up the whip, with an air of not being obliged to do it.</p>
<p>“Not to-day—another time. I am not riding my own horse.”</p>
<p>“Shall you see Mary to-day?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so,” said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge.</p>
<p>“Tell her to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make
fun.”</p>
<p>“Enough, enough, Ben! run away,” said Mrs. Garth, seeing that
Fred was teased. . .</p>
<p>“Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred,
when the children were gone and it was needful to say something
that would pass the time. He was not yet sure whether he should
wait for Mr. Garth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to
confess to Mrs. Garth herself, give her the money and ride
away.</p>
<p>“One—only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am
not getting a great income now,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling. “I am at
a low ebb with pupils. But I have saved my little purse for
Alfred’s premium: I have ninety-two pounds. He can go to Mr.
Hanmer’s now; he is just at the right age.”</p>
<p>This did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on
the brink of losing ninety-two pounds and more. Fred was silent.
“Young gentlemen who go to college are rather more costly than
that,” Mrs. Garth innocently continued, pulling out the edging on a
cap-border. “And Caleb thinks that Alfred will turn out a
distinguished engineer: he wants to give the boy a good chance.
There he is! I hear him coming in. We will go to him in the parlor,
shall we?”</p>
<p>When they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his hat and
was seated at his desk.</p>
<p>“What! Fred, my boy!” he said, in a tone of mild surprise,
holding his pen still undipped; “you are here betimes.” But missing
the usual expression of cheerful greeting in Fred’s face, he
immediately added, “Is there anything up at home?—anything the
matter?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid
will give you a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs.
Garth that I can’t keep my word. I can’t find the money to meet the
bill after all. I have been unfortunate; I have only got these
fifty pounds towards the hundred and sixty.”</p>
<p>While Fred was speaking, he had taken out the notes and laid
them on the desk before Mr. Garth. He had burst forth at once with
the plain fact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal
resources. Mrs. Garth was mutely astonished, and looked at her
husband for an explanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause
said—</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred;
it was for a hundred and sixty pounds. He made sure he could meet
it himself.”</p>
<p>There was an evident change in Mrs. Garth’s face, but it was
like a change below the surface of water which remains smooth. She
fixed her eyes on Fred, saying—</p>
<p>“I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money
and he has refused you.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Fred, biting his lip, and speaking with more
difficulty; ”but I know it will be of no use to ask him; and unless
it were of use, I should not like to mention Mr. Garth’s name in
the matter.“</p>
<p>“It has come at an unfortunate time,” said Caleb, in his
hesitating way, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering
the paper, “Christmas upon us—I’m rather hard up just now. You see,
I have to cut out everything like a tailor with short measure. What
can we do, Susan? I shall want every farthing we have in the bank.
It’s a hundred and ten pounds, the deuce take it!”</p>
<p>“I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for
Alfred’s premium,” said Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though
a nice ear might have discerned a slight tremor in some of the
words. “And I have no doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from
her salary by this time. She will advance it.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the
least calculating what words she should use to cut him the most
effectively. Like the eccentric woman she was, she was at present
absorbed in considering what was to be done, and did not fancy that
the end could be better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions.
But she had made Fred feel for the first time something like the
tooth of remorse. Curiously enough, his pain in the affair
beforehand had consisted almost entirely in the sense that he must
seem dishonorable, and sink in the opinion of the Garths: he had
not occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury
that his breach might occasion them, for this exercise of the
imagination on other people’s needs is not common with hopeful
young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought up in the notion
that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is something
irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong. But at this
moment he suddenly saw himself as a pitiful rascal who was robbing
two women of their savings.</p>
<p>“I shall certainly pay it all, Mrs. Garth—ultimately,” he
stammered out.</p>
<p>“Yes, ultimately,” said Mrs. Garth, who having a special dislike
to fine words on ugly occasions, could not now repress an epigram.
“But boys cannot well be apprenticed ultimately: they should be
apprenticed at fifteen.” She had never been so little inclined to
make excuses for Fred.</p>
<p>“I was the most in the wrong, Susan,” said Caleb. “Fred made
sure of finding the money. But I’d no business to be fingering
bills. I suppose you have looked all round and tried all honest
means?” he added, fixing his merciful gray eyes on Fred. Caleb was
too delicate, to specify Mr. Featherstone.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have tried everything—I really have. I should have had a
hundred and thirty pounds ready but for a misfortune with a horse
which I was about to sell. My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and
I paid away thirty with my old horse in order to get another which
I was going to sell for eighty or more—I meant to go without a
horse—but now it has turned out vicious and lamed itself. I wish I
and the horses too had been at the devil, before I had brought this
on you. There’s no one else I care so much for: you and Mrs. Garth
have always been so kind to me. However, it’s no use saying that.
You will always think me a rascal now.”</p>
<p>Fred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that he
was getting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that his being
sorry was not of much use to the Garths. They could see him mount,
and quickly pass through the gate.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed in Fred Vincy,” said Mrs. Garth. “I would not
have believed beforehand that he would have drawn you into his
debts. I knew he was extravagant, but I did not think that he would
be so mean as to hang his risks on his oldest friend, who could the
least afford to lose.”</p>
<p>“I was a fool, Susan:”</p>
<p>“That you were,” said the wife, nodding and smiling. “But I
should not have gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should
you keep such things from me? It is just so with your buttons: you
let them burst off without telling me, and go out with your
wristband hanging. If I had only known I might have been ready with
some better plan.”</p>
<p>“You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan,” said Caleb, looking
feelingly at her. “I can’t abide your losing the money you’ve
scraped together for Alfred.”</p>
<p>“It is very well that I <i>had</i> scraped it together; and it
is you who will have to suffer, for you must teach the boy
yourself. You must give up your bad habits. Some men take to
drinking, and you have taken to working without pay. You must
indulge yourself a little less in that. And you must ride over to
Mary, and ask the child what money she has."</p>
<p>Caleb had pushed his chair back, and was leaning forward,
shaking his head slowly, and fitting his finger-tips together with
much nicety.</p>
<p>“Poor Mary!” he said. “Susan,“ he went on in a lowered tone,
”I’m afraid she may be fond of Fred.“</p>
<p>“Oh no! She always laughs at him; and he is not likely to think
of her in any other than a brotherly way.”</p>
<p>Caleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered his spectacles,
drew up his chair to the desk, and said, “Deuce take the bill—I
wish it was at Hanover! These things are a sad interruption to
business!”</p>
<p>The first part of this speech comprised his whole store of
maledictory expression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to
imagine. But it would be difficult to convey to those who never
heard him utter the word “business,“ the peculiar tone of fervid
veneration, of religious regard, in which he wrapped it, as a
consecrated symbol is wrapped in its gold-fringed linen.</p>
<p>Caleb Garth often shook his head in meditation on the value, the
indispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by
which the social body is fed, clothed, and housed. It had laid hold
of his imagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where
roof or keel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the
roar of the furnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a
sublime music to him; the felling and lading of timber, and the
huge trunk vibrating star-like in the distance along the highway,
the crane at work on the wharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses,
the precision and variety of muscular effort wherever exact work
had to be turned out,—all these sights of his youth had acted on
him as poetry without the aid of the poets, had made a philosophy
for him without the aid of philosophers, a religion without the aid
of theology. His early ambition had been to have as effective a
share as possible in this sublime labor, which was peculiarly
dignified by him with the name of “business;“ and though he had
only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his
own teacher, he knew more of land, building, and mining than most
of the special men in the county.</p>
<p>His classification of human employments was rather crude, and,
like the categories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable
in these advanced times. He divided them into “business, politics,
preaching, learning, and amusement.” He had nothing to say against
the last four; but he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded
other gods than his own. In the same way, he thought very well of
all ranks, but he would not himself have liked to be of any rank in
which he had not such close contact with “business“ as to get often
honorably decorated with marks of dust and mortar, the damp of the
engine, or the sweet soil of the woods and fields. Though he had
never regarded himself as other than an orthodox Christian, and
would argue on prevenient grace if the subject were proposed to
him, I think his virtual divinities were good practical schemes,
accurate work, and the faithful completion of undertakings: his
prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was no spirit of
denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to him that he
was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of
firmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best
land-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious
boring (for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong
practical intelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew
values well, but he had no keenness of imagination for monetary
results in the shape of profit and loss: and having ascertained
this to his cost, he determined to give up all forms of his beloved
”business” which required that talent. He gave himself up entirely
to the many kinds of work which he could do without handling
capital, and was one of those precious men within his own district
whom everybody would choose to work for them, because he did his
work well, charged very little, and often declined to charge at
all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and “lived
in a small way.” However, they did not mind it.</p>
