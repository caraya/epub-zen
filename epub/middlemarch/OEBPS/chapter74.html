<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">In</span> Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the
town held a bad opinion of her husband. No feminine intimate might
carry her friendship so far as to make a plain statement to the
wife of the unpleasant fact known or believed about her husband;
but when a woman with her thoughts much at leisure got them
suddenly employed on something grievously disadvantageous to her
neighbors, various moral impulses were called into play which
tended to stimulate utterance. Candor was one. To be candid, in
Middlemarch phraseology, meant, to use an early opportunity of
letting your friends know that you did not take a cheerful view of
their capacity, their conduct, or their position; and a robust
candor never waited to be asked for its opinion. Then, again, there
was the love of truth—a wide phrase, but meaning in this relation,
a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than her husband's
character warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in her
lot—the poor thing should have some hint given her that if she knew
the truth she would have less complacency in her bonnet, and in
light dishes for a supper-party. Stronger than all, there was the
regard for a friend's moral improvement, sometimes called her soul,
which was likely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom,
uttered with the accompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture
and a manner implying that the speaker would not tell what was on
her mind, from regard to the feelings of her hearer. On the whole,
one might say that an ardent charity was at work setting the
virtuous mind to make a neighbor unhappy for her good.</p>
<p>There were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial
misfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of
this moral activity than Rosamond and her aunt Bulstrode. Mrs.
Bulstrode was not an object of dislike, and had never consciously
injured any human being. Men had always thought her a handsome
comfortable woman, and had reckoned it among the signs of
Bulstrode’s hypocrisy that he had chosen a red-blooded Vincy,
instead of a ghastly and melancholy person suited to his low esteem
for earthly pleasure. When the scandal about her husband was
disclosed they remarked of her—“Ah, poor woman! She’s as honest as
the day—<i>she</i> never suspected anything wrong in him, you may
depend on it." Women, who were intimate with her, talked together
much of "poor Harriet," imagined what her feelings must be when she
came to know everything, and conjectured how much she had already
come to know. There was no spiteful disposition towards her;
rather, there was a busy benevolence anxious to ascertain what it
would be well for her to feel and do under the circumstances, which
of course kept the imagination occupied with her character and
history from the times when she was Harriet Vincy till now. With
the review of Mrs. Bulstrode and her position it was inevitable to
associate Rosamond, whose prospects were under the same blight with
her aunt's. Rosamond was more severely criticised and less pitied,
though she too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had always
been known in Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage
with an interloper. The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they
lay on the surface: there was never anything bad to be "found out"
concerning them. Mrs. Bulstrode was vindicated from any resemblance
to her husband. Harriet's faults were her own.</p>
<p>“She has always been showy,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, making tea for
a small party, “though she has got into the way of putting her
religion forward, to conform to her husband; she has tried to hold
her head up above Middlemarch by making it known that she invites
clergymen and heaven-knows-who from Riverston and those
places.”</p>
<p>“We can hardly blame her for that,” said Mrs. Sprague; “because
few of the best people in the town cared to associate with
Balstrode, and she must have somebody to sit down at her
table.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Thesiger has always countenanced him,” said Mrs. Hackbutt.
“I think he must be sorry now.”</p>
<p>“But he was never fond of him in his heart—that every one
knows,” said Mrs. Tom Toller. “Mr. Thesiger never goes into
extremes. He keeps to the truth in what is evangelical. It is only
clergymen like Mr. Tyke, who want to use Dissenting hymn-books and
that low kind of religion, who ever found Bulstrode to their
taste.”</p>
<p>“I understand, Mr. Tyke is in great distress about him,” said
Mrs. Hackbutt. “And well he may be: they say the Bulstrodes have
half kept the Tyke family.”</p>
<p>“And of coarse it is a discredit to his doctrines,” said Mrs.
Sprague, who was elderly, and old-fashioned in her opinions.</p>
<p>“People will not make a boast of being methodistical in
Middlemarch for a good while to come.”</p>
<p>“I think we must not set down people’s bad actions to their
religion,” said falcon-faced Mrs. Plymdale, who had been listening
hitherto.</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear, we are forgetting,” said Mrs. Sprague. “We ought
not to be talking of this before you.”</p>
<p>“I am sure I have no reason to be partial,” said Mrs. Plymdale,
coloring. “It’s true Mr. Plymdale has always been on good terms
with Mr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before she
married him. But I have always kept my own opinions and told her
where she was wrong, poor thing. Still, in point of religion, I
must say, Mr. Bulstrode might have done what he has, and worse, and
yet have been a man of no religion. I don’t say that there has not
been a little too much of that—I like moderation myself. But truth
is truth. The men tried at the assizes are not all over-religious,
I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Well,“ said Mrs. Hackbutt, wheeling adroitly, ”all I can say
is, that I think she ought to separate from him.“</p>
<p>“I can’t say that,” said Mrs. Sprague. “She took him for better
or worse, you know.”</p>
<p>“But ’worse’ can never mean finding out that your husband is fit
for Newgate,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “Fancy living with such a man! I
should expect to be poisoned.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think myself it is an encouragement to crime if such men
are to be taken care of and waited on by good wives,” said Mrs. Tom
Toller.</p>
<p>“And a good wife poor Harriet has been,” said Mrs. Plymdale.
“She thinks her husband the first of men. It’s true he has never
denied her anything.”</p>
<p>“Well, we shall see what she will do,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “I
suppose she knows nothing yet, poor creature. I do hope and trust I
shall not see her, for I should be frightened to death lest I
should say anything about her husband. Do you think any hint has
reached her?”</p>
<p>“I should hardly think so,” said Mrs. Tom Toller. “We hear that
he is ill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting
on Thursday; but she was with her girls at church yesterday, and
they had new Tuscan bonnets. Her own had a feather in it. I have
never seen that her religion made any difference in her dress.”</p>
<p>“She wears very neat patterns always,” said Mrs. Plymdale, a
little stung. “And that feather I know she got dyed a pale lavender
on purpose to be consistent. I must say it of Harriet that she
wishes to do right.”</p>
<p>“As to her knowing what has happened, it can’t be kept from her
long,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “The Vincys know, for Mr. Vincy was at
the meeting. It will he a great blow to him. There is his daughter
as well as his sister.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Sprague. “Nobody supposes that Mr.
Lydgate can go on holding up his head in Middlemarch, things look
so black about the thousand pounds he took just at that man’s
death. It really makes one shudder.”</p>
<p>“Pride must have a fall,” said Mrs. Hackbutt.</p>
<p>“I am not so sorry for Rosamond Vincy that was as I am for her
aunt,” said Mrs. Plymdale. “She needed a lesson.”</p>
<p>“I suppose the Bulstrodes will go and live abroad somewhere,”
said Mrs. Sprague. “That is what is generally done when there is
anything disgraceful in a family.”</p>
<p>“And a most deadly blow it will be to Harriet,” said Mrs.
Plymdale. “If ever a woman was crushed, she will be. I pity her
from my heart. And with all her faults, few women are better. From
a girl she had the neatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and
as open as the day. You might look into her drawers when you
would—always the same. And so she has brought up Kate and Ellen.
You may think how hard it will be for her to go among
foreigners.”</p>
<p>“The doctor says that is what he should recommend the Lydgates
to do,” said Mrs. Sprague. “He says Lydgate ought to have kept
among the French.”</p>
<p>“That would suit <i>her</i> well enough, I dare say," said Mrs.
Plymdale; "there is that kind of lightness about her. But she got
that from her mother; she never got it from her aunt Bulstrode, who
always gave her good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have
had her marry elsewhere."</p>
<p>Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her some
complication of feeling. There had been not only her intimacy with
Mrs. Bulstrode, but also a profitable business relation of the
great Plymdale dyeing house with Mr. Bulstrode, which on the one
hand would have inclined her to desire that the mildest view of his
character should be the true one, but on the other, made her the
more afraid of seeming to palliate his culpability. Again, the late
alliance of her family with the Tollers had brought her in
connection with the best circle, which gratified her in every
direction except in the inclination to those serious views which
she believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little
woman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these
opposing “bests,“ and of her griefs and satisfactions under late
events, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but
also to fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have
preferred seeing on a background of prosperity.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by
the oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that
secret uneasiness which had always been present in her since the
last visit of Raffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come
ill to Stone Court, and that her husband had chosen to remain there
and watch over him, she allowed to be explained by the fact that
Raffles had been employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this
made a tie of benevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness;
and she had been since then innocently cheered by her husband’s
more hopeful speech about his own health and ability to continue
his attention to business. The calm was disturbed when Lydgate had
brought him home ill from the meeting, and in spite of comforting
assurances during the next few days, she cried in private from the
conviction that her husband was not suffering from bodily illness
merely, but from something that afflicted his mind. He would not
allow her to read to him, and scarcely to sit with him, alleging
nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet she suspected
that in shutting himself up in his private room he wanted to be
busy with his papers. Something, she felt sure, had happened.
Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and she was kept in the
dark. Not daring to question her husband, she said to Lydgate, on
the fifth day after the meeting, when she had not left home except
to go to church—</p>
<p>“Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth.
Has anything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?”</p>
<p>“Some little nervous shock,” said Lydgate, evasively. He felt
that it was not for him to make the painful revelation.</p>
<p>“But what brought it on?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly
at him with her large dark eyes.</p>
<p>“There is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms,”
said Lydgate. “Strong men can stand it, but it tells on people in
proportion to the delicacy of their systems. It is often impossible
to account for the precise moment of an attack—or rather, to say
why the strength gives way at a particular moment.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There
remained in her the belief that some calamity had befallen her
husband, of which she was to be kept in ignorance; and it was in
her nature strongly to object to such concealment. She begged leave
for her daughters to sit with their father, and drove into the town
to pay some visits, conjecturing that if anything were known to
have gone wrong in Mr. Bulstrode’s affairs, she should see or hear
some sign of it.</p>
<p>She called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove
to Mrs. Hackbutt’s on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs.
Hackbutt saw her coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering
her former alarm lest she should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost
bound in consistency to send word that she was not at home; but
against that, there was a sudden strong desire within her for the
excitement of an interview in which she was quite determined not to
make the slightest allusion to what was in her mind.</p>
<p>Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs.
Hackbutt went to her, with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her
hands than was usually observable in her, these being precautions
adopted against freedom of speech. She was resolved not to ask how
Mr. Bulstrode was.</p>
<p>“I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week,”
said Mrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. “But Mr.
Bulstrode was taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday that I have
not liked to leave the house.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the
other held against her chest, and let her eyes ramble over the
pattern on the rug.</p>
<p>“Was Mr. Hackbutt at the meeting?” persevered Mrs.
Bulstrode.</p>
<p>“Yes, he was,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. “The
land is to be bought by subscription, I believe.”</p>
<p>“Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be
buried in it,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “It is an awful visitation. But
I always think Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is
being used to it from a child; but I never saw the town I should
like to live at better, and especially our end.”</p>
<p>“I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at
Middlemarch, Mrs. Bulstrode,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight
sigh. “Still, we must learn to resign ourselves, wherever our lot
may be cast. Though I am sure there will always be people in this
town who will wish you well.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say, “if you take my advice you will
part from your husband,” but it seemed clear to her that the poor
woman knew nothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her head, and
she herself could do no more than prepare her a little. Mrs.
Bulstrode felt suddenly rather chill and trembling: there was
evidently something unusual behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt’s;
but though she had set out with the desire to be fully informed,
she found herself unable now to pursue her brave purpose, and
turning the conversation by an inquiry about the young Hackbutts,
she soon took her leave saying that she was going to see Mrs.
Plymdale. On her way thither she tried to imagine that there might
have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.
Bulstrode and some of his frequent opponents—perhaps Mr. Hackbutt
might have been one of them. That would account for everything.</p>
<p>But when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that
comforting explanation seemed no longer tenable. “Selina“ received
her with a pathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give
edifying answers on the commonest topics, which could hardly have
reference to an ordinary quarrel of which the most important
consequence was a perturbation of Mr. Bulstrode’s health.
Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she would sooner
question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to her
surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is
easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered
communication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of
being pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow
her the superiority. For certain words of mysterious
appropriateness that Mrs. Plymdale let fall about her resolution
never to turn her back on her friends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode
that what had happened must be some kind of misfortune, and instead
of being able to say with her native directness, ”What is it that
you have in your mind?“ she found herself anxious to get away
before she had heard anything more explicit. She began to have an
agitating certainty that the misfortune was something more than the
mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact that Selina
now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided noticing what
she said about her husband, as they would have avoided noticing a
personal blemish.</p>
<p>She said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to
drive to Mr. Vincy’s warehouse. In that short drive her dread
gathered so much force from the sense of darkness, that when she
entered the private counting-house where her brother sat at his
desk, her knees trembled and her usually florid face was deathly
pale. Something of the same effect was produced in him by the sight
of her: he rose from his seat to meet her, took her by the hand,
and said, with his impulsive rashness—</p>
<p>“God help you, Harriet! you know all.”</p>
<p>That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It
contained that concentrated experience which in great crises of
emotion reveals the bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the
ultimate act which will end an intermediate struggle. Without that
memory of Raffles she might still have thought only of monetary
ruin, but now along with her brother’s look and words there darted
into her mind the idea of some guilt in her husband—then, under the
working of terror came the image of her husband exposed to
disgrace—and then, after an instant of scorching shame in which she
felt only the eyes of the world, with one leap of her heart she was
at his side in mournful but unreproaching fellowship with shame and
isolation. All this went on within her in a mere flash of
time—while she sank into the chair, and raised her eyes to her
brother, who stood over her. “I know nothing, Walter. What is it?”
she said, faintly.</p>
<p>He told her everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments,
making her aware that the scandal went much beyond proof,
especially as to the end of Raffles.</p>
<p>“People will talk,” he said. “Even if a man has been acquitted
by a jury, they’ll talk, and nod and wink—and as far as the world
goes, a man might often as well be guilty as not. It’s a breakdown
blow, and it damages Lydgate as much as Bulstrode. I don’t pretend
to say what is the truth. I only wish we had never heard the name
of either Bulstrode or Lydgate. You’d better have been a Vincy all
your life, and so had Rosamond.” Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply.</p>
<p>“But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don’t
blame <i>you</i>. And I'll stand by you whatever you make up your
mind to do," said the brother, with rough but well-meaning
affectionateness.</p>
<p>“Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,” said Mrs. Bulstrode.
“I feel very weak.”</p>
<p>And when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter, “I
am not well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa.
Leave me in quiet. I shall take no dinner.”</p>
<p>She locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used to
her maimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she could
walk steadily to the place allotted her. A new searching light had
fallen on her husband’s character, and she could not judge him
leniently: the twenty years in which she had believed in him and
venerated him by virtue of his concealments came back with
particulars that made them seem an odious deceit. He had married
her with that bad past life hidden behind him, and she had no faith
left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him.
Her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited
dishonor as bitter as it could be to any mortal.</p>
<p>But this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were
an odd patchwork, had a loyal spirit within her. The man whose
prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life, and who had
unvaryingly cherished her—now that punishment had befallen him it
was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him. There is a
forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on the same
couch with the forsaken soul, withering it the more by unloving
proximity. She knew, when she locked her door, that she should
unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband and espouse his
sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will mourn and not reproach. But
she needed time to gather up her strength; she needed to sob out
her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her life. When she
had resolved to go down, she prepared herself by some little acts
which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were her way
of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had
begun a new life in which she embraced humiliation. She took off
all her ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of
wearing her much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed
her hair down and put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look
suddenly like an early Methodist.</p>
<p>Bulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in
saying that she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation
equal to hers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth from
others, and had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier
to him than any confession. But now that he imagined the moment of
her knowledge come, he awaited the result in anguish. His daughters
had been obliged to consent to leave him, and though he had allowed
some food to be brought to him, he had not touched it. He felt
himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery. Perhaps he should
never see his wife’s face with affection in it again. And if he
turned to God there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of
retribution.</p>
<p>It was eight o’clock in the evening before the door opened and
his wife entered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with his eyes
bent down, and as she went towards him she thought he looked
smaller—he seemed so withered and shrunken. A movement of new
compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave,
and putting one hand on his which rested on the arm of the chair,
and the other on his shoulder, she said, solemnly but kindly—</p>
<p>“Look up, Nicholas.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half
amazed for a moment: her pale face, her changed, mourning dress,
the trembling about her mouth, all said, “I know;” and her hands
and eyes rested gently on him. He burst out crying and they cried
together, she sitting at his side. They could not yet speak to each
other of the shame which she was bearing with him, or of the acts
which had brought it down on them. His confession was silent, and
her promise of faithfulness was silent. Open-minded as she was, she
nevertheless shrank from the words which would have expressed their
mutual consciousness, as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire.
She could not say, “How much is only slander and false suspicion?”
and he did not say, “I am innocent.”</p>
