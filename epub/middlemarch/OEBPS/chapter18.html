          “Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth <br/>
          Draw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,<br/>
          Breathing bad air, ran risk of pestilence;<br/>
          Or, lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line,<br/>
          May languish with the scurvy."<br/>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">S</span>ome weeks passed after this conversation before the question of
the chaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and
without telling himself the reason, he deferred the
predetermination on which side he should give his vote. It would
really have been a matter of total indifference to him—that is to
say, he would have taken the more convenient side, and given his
vote for the appointment of Tyke without any hesitation—if he had
not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p>But his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph’s grew with growing
acquaintanceship. That, entering into Lydgate’s position as a
new-comer who had his own professional objects to secure, Mr.
Farebrother should have taken pains rather to warn off than to
obtain his interest, showed an unusual delicacy and generosity,
which Lydgate’s nature was keenly alive to. It went along with
other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother which were exceptionally
fine, and made his character resemble those southern landscapes
which seem divided between natural grandeur and social
slovenliness. Very few men could have been as filial and chivalrous
as he was to the mother, aunt, and sister, whose dependence on him
had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself; few
men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not
to dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext
of better motives. In these matters he was conscious that his life
would bear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps the consciousness
encouraged a little defiance towards the critical strictness of
persons whose celestial intimacies seemed not to improve their
domestic manners, and whose lofty aims were not needed to account
for their actions. Then, his preaching was ingenious and pithy,
like the preaching of the English Church in its robust age, and his
sermons were delivered without book. People outside his parish went
to hear him; and, since to fill the church was always the most
difficult part of a clergyman’s function, here was another ground
for a careless sense of superiority. Besides, he was a likable man:
sweet-tempered, ready-witted, frank, without grins of suppressed
bitterness or other conversational flavors which make half of us an
affliction to our friends. Lydgate liked him heartily, and wished
for his friendship.</p>
<p>With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question
of the chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no
proper business of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a
demand for his vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was
laying down plans for the internal arrangements of the new
hospital, and the two were often in consultation. The banker was
always presupposing that he could count in general on Lydgate as a
coadjutor, but made no special recurrence to the coming decision
between Tyke and Farebrother. When the General Board of the
Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had notice that the
question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of the directors
and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had a vexed
sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch
business. He could not help hearing within him the distinct
declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke
affair was a question of office or no office; and he could not help
an equally pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office.
For his observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s
assurance that the banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound
their petty politics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings
in the meditative process of shaving, when he had begun to feel
that he must really hold a court of conscience on this matter.
Certainly there were valid things to be said against the election
of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on his hands already,
especially considering how much time he spent on non-clerical
occupations. Then again it was a continually repeated shock,
disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously play
for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently liking
some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory for
the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was
stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would
have played very much less but for the money. There was a
billiard-room at the Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and
wives regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar
was a first-rate billiard-player, and though he did not frequent
the Green Dragon, there were reports that he had sometimes been
there in the daytime and had won money. And as to the chaplaincy,
he did not pretend that he cared for it, except for the sake of the
forty pounds. Lydgate was no Puritan, but he did not care for play,
and winning money at it had always seemed a meanness to him;
besides, he had an ideal of life which made this subservience of
conduct to the gaining of small sums thoroughly hateful to him.
Hitherto in his own life his wants had been supplied without any
trouble to himself, and his first impulse was always to be liberal
with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a gentleman; it had
never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting half-crowns. He
had always known in a general way that he was not rich, but he had
never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part which
the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money
had never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame
excuses for this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was
altogether repulsive to him, and he never entered into any
calculation of the ratio between the Vicar’s income and his more or
less necessary expenditure. It was possible that he would not have
made such a calculation in his own case.</p>
<p>And now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive
fact told more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done
before. One would know much better what to do if men’s characters
were more consistent, and especially if one’s friends were
invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake! Lydgate
was convinced that if there had been no valid objection to Mr.
Farebrother, he would have voted for him, whatever Bulstrode might
have felt on the subject: he did not intend to be a vassal of
Bulstrode’s. On the other hand, there was Tyke, a man entirely
given to his clerical office, who was simply curate at a chapel of
ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for extra duty. Nobody had
anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that they could not bear
him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his point of view,
Bulstrode was thoroughly justified.</p>
<p>But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something
to make him wince; and being a proud man, he was a little
exasperated at being obliged to wince. He did not like frustrating
his own best purposes by getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he
did not like voting against Farebrother, and helping to deprive him
of function and salary; and the question occurred whether the
additional forty pounds might not leave the Vicar free from that
ignoble care about winning at cards. Moreover, Lydgate did not like
the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he should be voting on
the side obviously convenient for himself. But would the end really
be his own convenience? Other people would say so, and would allege
that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake of making
himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He for
his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been
concerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s
friendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his
work, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to
prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could
demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic
results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For
the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike
pressure of small social conditions, and their frustrating
complexity. At the end of his inward debate, when he set out for
the hospital, his hope was really in the chance that discussion
might somehow give a new aspect to the question, and make the scale
dip so as to exclude the necessity for voting. I think he trusted a
little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances—some
feeling rushing warmly and making resolve easy, while debate in
cool blood had only made it more difficult. However it was, he did
not distinctly say to himself on which side he would vote; and all
the while he was inwardly resenting the subjection which had been
forced upon him. It would have seemed beforehand like a ridiculous
piece of bad logic that he, with his unmixed resolutions of
independence and his select purposes, would find himself at the
very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of which was
repugnant to him. In his student’s chambers, he had prearranged his
social action quite differently.</p>
<p>Lydgate was late in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other
surgeons, and several of the directors had arrived early; Mr.
Bulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still
absent. The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was
problematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as
had been generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder,
turned out to be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds,
they concurred in action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was,
as every one had foreseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The
Doctor was more than suspected of having no religion, but somehow
Middlemarch tolerated this deficiency in him as if he had been a
Lord Chancellor; indeed it is probable that his professional weight
was the more believed in, the world-old association of cleverness
with the evil principle being still potent in the minds even of
lady-patients who had the strictest ideas of frilling and
sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor which made
his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted; conditions of
texture which were also held favorable to the storing of judgments
connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if any
medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having
very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of
otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general
presumption against his medical skill.</p>
<p>On this ground it was (professionally speaking) fortunate for
Dr. Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind,
and such as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious
sentiment, whether of Church or Dissent, rather than any adhesion
to particular tenets. If Mr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to
do, on the Lutheran doctrine of justification, as that by which a
Church must stand or fall, Dr. Minchin in return was quite sure
that man was not a mere machine or a fortuitous conjunction of
atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a particular providence in
relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin for his part liked
to keep the mental windows open and objected to fixed limits; if
the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian Creed, Dr. Minchin
quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the rather free style
of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring
well-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it
was generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and
sometimes spent his holidays at “the palace.”</p>
<p>Dr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded
outline, not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in
appearance: whereas Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his
trousers got creased at the knees, and showed an excess of boot at
a time when straps seemed necessary to any dignity of bearing; you
heard him go in and out, and up and down, as if he had come to see
after the roofing. In short, he had weight, and might be expected
to grapple with a disease and throw it; while Dr. Minchin might be
better able to detect it lurking and to circumvent it. They enjoyed
about equally the mysterious privilege of medical reputation, and
concealed with much etiquette their contempt for each other’s
skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch institutions, they were
ready to combine against all innovators, and against
non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they were
both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.
Minchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never
differed from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode,
who had found that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. A
layman who pried into the professional conduct of medical men, and
was always obtruding his reforms,—though he was less directly
embarrassing to the two physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries
who attended paupers by contract, was nevertheless offensive to the
professional nostril as such; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the
new pique against Bulstrode, excited by his apparent determination
to patronize Lydgate. The long-established practitioners, Mr.
Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just now standing apart and having a
friendly colloquy, in which they agreed that Lydgate was a
jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose. To non-medical
friends they had already concurred in praising the other young
practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock’s
retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and
such argument for solid professional acquirement as might be
gathered from his having apparently wasted no time on other
branches of knowledge. It was clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing
drugs, intended to cast imputations on his equals, and also to
obscure the limit between his own rank as a general practitioner
and that of the physicians, who, in the interest of the profession,
felt bound to maintain its various grades,—especially against a man
who had not been to either of the English universities and enjoyed
the absence of anatomical and bedside study there, but came with a
libellous pretension to experience in Edinburgh and Paris, where
observation might be abundant indeed, but hardly sound.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became
identified with Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this
variety of interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question,
diverse minds were enabled to form the same judgment concerning
it.</p>
<p>Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he
entered, “I go for Farebrother. A salary, with all my heart. But
why take it from the Vicar? He has none too much—has to insure his
life, besides keeping house, and doing a vicar’s charities. Put
forty pounds in his pocket and you’ll do no harm. He’s a good
fellow, is Farebrother, with as little of the parson about him as
will serve to carry orders.”</p>
<p>“Ho, ho! Doctor,” said old Mr. Powderell, a retired iron-monger
of some standing—his interjection being something between a laugh
and a Parliamentary disapproval; “we must let you have your say.
But what we have to consider is not anybody’s income—it’s the souls
of the poor sick people”—here Mr. Powderell’s voice and face had a
sincere pathos in them. “He is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke.
I should vote against my conscience if I voted against Mr. Tyke—I
should indeed.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Tyke’s opponents have not asked any one to vote against his
conscience, I believe,” said Mr. Hackbutt, a rich tanner of fluent
speech, whose glittering spectacles and erect hair were turned with
some severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell. “But in my judgment
it behoves us, as Directors, to consider whether we will regard it
as our whole business to carry out propositions emanating from a
single quarter. Will any member of the committee aver that he would
have entertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has
always discharged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been
suggested to him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every
institution of this town as a machinery for carrying out their own
views? I tax no man’s motives: let them lie between himself and a
higher Power; but I do say, that there are influences at work here
which are incompatible with genuine independence, and that a
crawling servility is usually dictated by circumstances which
gentlemen so conducting themselves could not afford either morally
or financially to avow. I myself am a layman, but I have given no
inconsiderable attention to the divisions in the Church and—”</p>
<p>“Oh, damn the divisions!” burst in Mr. Frank Hawley, lawyer and
town-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now
looked in hurriedly, whip in hand. “We have nothing to do with them
here. Farebrother has been doing the work—what there was—without
pay, and if pay is to be given, it should be given to him. I call
it a confounded job to take the thing away from Farebrother.”</p>
<p>“I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their
remarks a personal bearing,” said Mr. Plymdale. “I shall vote for
the appointment of Mr. Tyke, but I should not have known, if Mr.
Hackbutt hadn’t hinted it, that I was a Servile Crawler.”</p>
<p>“I disclaim any personalities. I expressly said, if I may be
allowed to repeat, or even to conclude what I was about to
say—”</p>
<p>“Ah, here’s Minchin!” said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody
turned away from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him to feel the uselessness
of superior gifts in Middlemarch. “Come, Doctor, I must have you on
the right side, eh?”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” said Dr. Minchin, nodding and shaking hands here
and there; “at whatever cost to my feelings.”</p>
<p>“If there’s any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man
who is turned out, I think,” said Mr. Frank Hawley.</p>
<p>“I confess I have feelings on the other side also. I have a
divided esteem,” said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his hands. “I consider
Mr. Tyke an exemplary man—none more so—and I believe him to be
proposed from unimpeachable motives. I, for my part, wish that I
could give him my vote. But I am constrained to take a view of the
case which gives the preponderance to Mr. Farebrother’s claims. He
is an amiable man, an able preacher, and has been longer among
us.”</p>
<p>Old Mr. Powderell looked on, sad and silent. Mr. Plymdale
settled his cravat, uneasily.</p>
<p>“You don’t set up Farebrother as a pattern of what a clergyman
ought to be, I hope,” said Mr. Larcher, the eminent carrier, who
had just come in. “I have no ill-will towards him, but I think we
owe something to the public, not to speak of anything higher, in
these appointments. In my opinion Farebrother is too lax for a
clergyman. I don’t wish to bring up particulars against him; but he
will make a little attendance here go as far as he can.”</p>
<p>“And a devilish deal better than too much,” said Mr. Hawley,
whose bad language was notorious in that part of the county. “Sick
people can’t bear so much praying and preaching. And that
methodistical sort of religion is bad for the spirits—bad for the
inside, eh?” he added, turning quickly round to the four medical
men who were assembled.</p>
<p>But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three
gentlemen, with whom there were greetings more or less cordial.
These were the Reverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter’s, Mr.
Bulstrode, and our friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately
allowed himself to be put on the board of directors in his turn,
but had never before attended, his attendance now being due to Mr.
Bulstrode’s exertions. Lydgate was the only person still
expected.</p>
<p>Every one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and
self-restrained as usual. Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical,
wished for the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able
man, who, officiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls
too extensive to leave him ample time for the new duty. It was
desirable that chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with
a fervent intention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual
influence; and while it was good that a salary should be allotted,
there was the more need for scrupulous watching lest the office
should be perverted into a mere question of salary. Mr. Thesiger’s
manner had so much quiet propriety that objectors could only simmer
in silence.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter. He
had not himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he
had a strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of
Middlemarch, and was most happy to meet the gentlemen present on
any public question—“any public question, you know,” Mr. Brooke
repeated, with his nod of perfect understanding. “I am a good deal
occupied as a magistrate, and in the collection of documentary
evidence, but I regard my time as being at the disposal of the
public—and, in short, my friends have convinced me that a chaplain
with a salary—a salary, you know—is a very good thing, and I am
happy to be able to come here and vote for the appointment of Mr.
Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable man, apostolic and
eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the last man to
withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.”</p>
<p>“It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the
question, Mr. Brooke,” said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of
nobody, and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions.
“You don’t seem to know that one of the worthiest men we have has
been doing duty as chaplain here for years without pay, and that
Mr. Tyke is proposed to supersede him.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,” said Mr. Bulstrode. “Mr. Brooke has
been fully informed of Mr. Farebrother’s character and
position.”</p>
<p>“By his enemies,” flashed out Mr. Hawley.</p>
<p>“I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,” said
Mr. Thesiger.</p>
<p>“I’ll swear there is, though,” retorted Mr. Hawley.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,“ said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, ”the merits
of the question may be very briefly stated, and if any one present
doubts that every gentleman who is about to give his vote has not
been fully informed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that
should weigh on either side.“</p>
<p>“I don’t see the good of that,” said Mr. Hawley. “I suppose we
all know whom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice
does not wait till the last minute to hear both sides of the
question. I have no time to lose, and I propose that the matter be
put to the vote at once.”</p>
<p>A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person
wrote “Tyke“ or ”Farebrother” on a piece of paper and slipped it
into a glass tumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw
Lydgate enter.</p>
<p>“I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said
Mr. Bulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at
Lydgate—</p>
<p>“There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr.
Lydgate: will you be good enough to write?”</p>
<p>“The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all
know how Mr. Lydgate will vote.”</p>
<p>“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said
Lydgate, rather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.</p>
<p>“I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode.
Do you regard that meaning as offensive?”</p>
<p>“It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from
voting with him on that account.” Lydgate immediately wrote down
“Tyke.“</p>
<p>So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and
Lydgate continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really
uncertain whether Tyke were not the more suitable candidate, and
yet his consciousness told him that if he had been quite free from
indirect bias he should have voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair
of the chaplaincy remained a sore point in his memory as a case in
which this petty medium of Middlemarch had been too strong for him.
How could a man be satisfied with a decision between such
alternatives and under such circumstances? No more than he can be
satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from among such shapes
as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at best with a
resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.</p>
<p>But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as
before. The character of the publican and sinner is not always
practically incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the
majority of us scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our
own conduct than the faultiness of our own arguments, or the
dulness of our own jokes. But the Vicar of St. Botolph’s had
certainly escaped the slightest tincture of the Pharisee, and by
dint of admitting to himself that he was too much as other men
were, he had become remarkably unlike them in this—that he could
excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and could judge
impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.</p>
<p>“The world has been to strong for <i>me</i>, I know," he said
one day to Lydgate. "But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never
be a man of renown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but
Prodicus makes it easy work for the hero, as if the first resolves
were enough. Another story says that he came to hold the distaff,
and at last wore the Nessus shirt. I suppose one good resolve might
keep a man right if everybody else's resolve helped him."</p>
<p>The Vicar’s talk was not always inspiriting: he had escaped
being a Pharisee, but he had not escaped that low estimate of
possibilities which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference
from our own failure. Lydgate thought that there was a pitiable
infirmity of will in Mr. Farebrother.</p>
