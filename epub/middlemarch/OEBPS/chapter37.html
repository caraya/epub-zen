         That neither will for better be allured<br/>

         Such self-assurance need not fear the spight<br/>

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he doubt hinted by Mr. Vincy whether it were only the general
election or the end of the world that was coming on, now that
George the Fourth was dead, Parliament dissolved, Wellington and
Peel generally depreciated and the new King apologetic, was a
feeble type of the uncertainties in provincial opinion at that
time. With the glow-worm lights of country places, how could men
see which were their own thoughts in the confusion of a Tory
Ministry passing Liberal measures, of Tory nobles and electors
being anxious to return Liberals rather than friends of the
recreant Ministers, and of outcries for remedies which seemed to
have a mysteriously remote bearing on private interest, and were
made suspicious by the advocacy of disagreeable neighbors? Buyers
of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous
position: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had
given up the "Pioneer"—which had a motto from Charles James Fox and
was in the van of progress—because it had taken Peel's side about
the Papists, and had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration
of Jesuitry and Baal; but they were ill-satisfied with the
"Trumpet," which—since its blasts against Rome, and in the general
flaccidity of the public mind (nobody knowing who would support
whom)—had become feeble in its blowing.</p>
<p>It was a time, according to a noticeable article in the
“Pioneer,“ when the crying needs of the country might well
counteract a reluctance to public action on the part of men whose
minds had from long experience acquired breadth as well as
concentration, decision of judgment as well as tolerance,
dispassionateness as well as energy—in fact, all those qualities
which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the least
disposed to share lodgings.</p>
<p>Mr. Hackbutt, whose fluent speech was at that time floating more
widely than usual, and leaving much uncertainty as to its ultimate
channel, was heard to say in Mr. Hawley’s office that the article
in question “emanated“ from Brooke of Tipton, and that Brooke had
secretly bought the ”Pioneer” some months ago.</p>
<p>“That means mischief, eh?” said Mr. Hawley. “He’s got the freak
of being a popular man now, after dangling about like a stray
tortoise. So much the worse for him. I’ve had my eye on him for
some time. He shall be prettily pumped upon. He’s a damned bad
landlord. What business has an old county man to come currying
favor with a low set of dark-blue freemen? As to his paper, I only
hope he may do the writing himself. It would be worth our paying
for.”</p>
<p>“I understand he has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit
it, who can write the highest style of leading article, quite equal
to anything in the London papers. And he means to take very high
ground on Reform.”</p>
<p>“Let Brooke reform his rent-roll. He’s a cursed old screw, and
the buildings all over his estate are going to rack. I suppose this
young fellow is some loose fish from London.”</p>
<p>“His name is Ladislaw. He is said to be of foreign
extraction.”</p>
<p>“I know the sort,” said Mr. Hawley; “some emissary. He’ll begin
with flourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a
wench. That’s the style.”</p>
<p>“You must concede that there are abuses, Hawley,” said Mr.
Hackbutt, foreseeing some political disagreement with his family
lawyer. “I myself should never favor immoderate views—in fact I
take my stand with Huskisson—but I cannot blind myself to the
consideration that the non-representation of large towns—”</p>
<p>“Large towns be damned!” said Mr. Hawley, impatient of
exposition. “I know a little too much about Middlemarch elections.
Let ’em quash every pocket borough to-morrow, and bring in every
mushroom town in the kingdom—they’ll only increase the expense of
getting into Parliament. I go upon facts.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hawley’s disgust at the notion of the “Pioneer“ being edited
by an emissary, and of Brooke becoming actively political—as if a
tortoise of desultory pursuits should protrude its small head
ambitiously and become rampant—was hardly equal to the annoyance
felt by some members of Mr. Brooke’s own family. The result had
oozed forth gradually, like the discovery that your neighbor has
set up an unpleasant kind of manufacture which will be permanently
under your nostrils without legal remedy. The ”Pioneer” had been
secretly bought even before Will Ladislaw’s arrival, the expected
opportunity having offered itself in the readiness of the
proprietor to part with a valuable property which did not pay; and
in the interval since Mr. Brooke had written his invitation, those
germinal ideas of making his mind tell upon the world at large
which had been present in him from his younger years, but had
hitherto lain in some obstruction, had been sprouting under
cover.</p>
<p>The development was much furthered by a delight in his guest
which proved greater even than he had anticipated. For it seemed
that Will was not only at home in all those artistic and literary
subjects which Mr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he
was strikingly ready at seizing the points of the political
situation, and dealing with them in that large spirit which, aided
by adequate memory, lends itself to quotation and general
effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p>“He seems to me a kind of Shelley, you know,” Mr. Brooke took an
opportunity of saying, for the gratification of Mr. Casaubon. “I
don’t mean as to anything objectionable—laxities or atheism, or
anything of that kind, you know—Ladislaw’s sentiments in every way
I am sure are good—indeed, we were talking a great deal together
last night. But he has the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty,
freedom, emancipation—a fine thing under guidance—under guidance,
you know. I think I shall be able to put him on the right tack; and
I am the more pleased because he is a relation of yours,
Casaubon.”</p>
<p>If the right tack implied anything more precise than the rest of
Mr. Brooke’s speech, Mr. Casaubon silently hoped that it referred
to some occupation at a great distance from Lowick. He had disliked
Will while he helped him, but he had begun to dislike him still
more now that Will had declined his help. That is the way with us
when we have any uneasy jealousy in our disposition: if our talents
are chiefly of the burrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin (whom
we have grave reasons for objecting to) is likely to have a secret
contempt for us, and any one who admires him passes an oblique
criticism on ourselves. Having the scruples of rectitude in our
souls, we are above the meanness of injuring him—rather we meet all
his claims on us by active benefits; and the drawing of cheques for
him, being a superiority which he must recognize, gives our
bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon had been deprived of
that superiority (as anything more than a remembrance) in a sudden,
capricious manner. His antipathy to Will did not spring from the
common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was something deeper,
bred by his lifelong claims and discontents; but Dorothea, now that
she was present—Dorothea, as a young wife who herself had shown an
offensive capability of criticism, necessarily gave concentration
to the uneasiness which had before been vague.</p>
<p>Will Ladislaw on his side felt that his dislike was flourishing
at the expense of his gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in
justifying the dislike. Casaubon hated him—he knew that very well;
on his first entrance he could discern a bitterness in the mouth
and a venom in the glance which would almost justify declaring war
in spite of past benefits. He was much obliged to Casaubon in the
past, but really the act of marrying this wife was a set-off
against the obligation. It was a question whether gratitude which
refers to what is done for one’s self ought not to give way to
indignation at what is done against another. And Casaubon had done
a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her. A man was bound to know
himself better than that, and if he chose to grow gray crunching
bones in a cavern, he had no business to be luring a girl into his
companionship. “It is the most horrible of virgin-sacrifices,” said
Will; and he painted to himself what were Dorothea’s inward sorrows
as if he had been writing a choric wail. But he would never lose
sight of her: he would watch over her—if he gave up everything else
in life he would watch over her, and she should know that she had
one slave in the world, Will had—to use Sir Thomas Browne’s
phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself and
others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him so
strongly as the presence of Dorothea.</p>
<p>Invitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for
Will had never been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed,
confident of doing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor
fellow, was too much absorbed to think of, had arranged to bring
Ladislaw to Lowick several times (not neglecting meanwhile to
introduce him elsewhere on every opportunity as “a young relative
of Casaubon’s”). And though Will had not seen Dorothea alone, their
interviews had been enough to restore her former sense of young
companionship with one who was cleverer than herself, yet seemed
ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea before her marriage had
never found much room in other minds for what she cared most to
say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s superior
instruction so much as she had expected. If she spoke with any
keenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he heard her with an air of
patience as if she had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar
to him from his tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what
ancient sects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there
were too much of that sort in stock already; at other times he
would inform her that she was mistaken, and reassert what her
remark had questioned.</p>
<p>But Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she said
than she herself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she had the
ardent woman’s need to rule beneficently by making the joy of
another soul. Hence the mere chance of seeing Will occasionally was
like a lunette opened in the wall of her prison, giving her a
glimpse of the sunny air; and this pleasure began to nullify her
original alarm at what her husband might think about the
introduction of Will as her uncle’s guest. On this subject Mr.
Casaubon had remained dumb.</p>
<p>But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient
of slow circumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse
between Dante and Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the
proportion of things, and in later days it is preferable to have
fewer sonnets and more conversation. Necessity excused stratagem,
but stratagem was limited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He
found out at last that he wanted to take a particular sketch at
Lowick; and one morning when Mr. Brooke had to drive along the
Lowick road on his way to the county town, Will asked to be set
down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at Lowick, and without
announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to sketch in a
position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to walk—and he
knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.</p>
<p>But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered
with treacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was
obliged to take shelter in the house. He intended, on the strength
of relationship, to go into the drawing-room and wait there without
being announced; and seeing his old acquaintance the butler in the
hall, he said, “Don’t mention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait
till luncheon; I know Mr. Casaubon does not like to be disturbed
when he is in the library.”</p>
<p>“Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library.
I’d better tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked
man given to lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with
her that it must be dull for Madam.</p>
<p>“Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from
sketching,” said Will, feeling so happy that he affected
indifference with delightful ease.</p>
<p>In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was
meeting him with her sweet unconstrained smile.</p>
<p>“Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once.
“I don’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner.
He was uncertain how long he should be. Did you want to say
anything particular to him?”</p>
<p>“No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would
not have disturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here,
and I know he dislikes interruption at this hour.”</p>
<p>“I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.”
Dorothea uttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an
unhappy child, visited at school.</p>
<p>“I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will,
mysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was. He could not
stay to ask himself, why not? “I wanted to talk about things, as we
did in Rome. It always makes a difference when other people are
present.”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent. ”Sit
down.” She seated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books
behind her, looking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white
material, without a single ornament on her besides her
wedding-ring, as if she were under a vow to be different from all
other women; and Will sat down opposite her at two yards’ distance,
the light falling on his bright curls and delicate but rather
petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip and chin. Each
looked at the other as if they had been two flowers which had
opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her husband’s
mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at her
thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had
found receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she
exaggerated a past solace.</p>
<p>“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,”
she said, immediately. “It seems strange to me how many things I
said to you.”</p>
<p>“I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content
in his soul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature
worthy to be perfectly loved. I think his own feelings at that
moment were perfect, for we mortals have our divine moments, when
love is satisfied in the completeness of the beloved object.</p>
<p>“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said
Dorothea. “I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to
understand just a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now.
I can find out references for him and save his eyes in many ways.
But it is very difficult to be learned; it seems as if people were
worn out on the way to great thoughts, and can never enjoy them
because they are too tired.”</p>
<p>“If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to
overtake them before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible
quickness. But through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick
as he, and seeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it
is quite true that the best minds have been sometimes overstrained
in working out their ideas.”</p>
<p>“You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I
should have said that those who have great thoughts get too much
worn in working them out. I used to feel about that, even when I
was a little girl; and it always seemed to me that the use I should
like to make of my life would be to help some one who did great
works, so that his burthen might be lighter.”</p>
<p>Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any
sense of making a revelation. But she had never before said
anything to Will which threw so strong a light on her marriage. He
did not shrug his shoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet
he thought the more irritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls
and other emptinesses ecclesiastically enshrined. Also he had to
take care that his speech should not betray that thought.</p>
<p>“But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get
over-wrought yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already
look paler. It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a
secretary; he could easily get a man who would do half his work for
him. It would save him more effectually, and you need only help him
in lighter ways.”</p>
<p>“How can you think of that?” said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest
remonstrance. “I should have no happiness if I did not help him in
his work. What could I do? There is no good to be done in Lowick.
The only thing I desire is to help him more. And he objects to a
secretary: please not to mention that again.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both
Mr. Brooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.”</p>
<p>“Yes?“ said Dorothea, ”but they don’t understand—they want me to
be a great deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new
conservatories, to fill up my days. I thought you could understand
that one’s mind has other wants,“ she added, rather
impatiently—”besides, Mr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a
secretary.“</p>
<p>“My mistake is excusable,” said Will. “In old days I used to
hear Mr. Casaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a
secretary. Indeed he held out the prospect of that office to me.
But I turned out to be—not good enough for it.”</p>
<p>Dorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her
husband’s evident repulsion, as she said, with a playful smile,
“You were not a steady worker enough.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the
manner of a spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon
prompting him to give another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor
Mr. Casaubon’s glory, he went on, ”And I have seen since that Mr.
Casaubon does not like any one to overlook his work and know
thoroughly what he is doing. He is too doubtful—too uncertain of
himself. I may not be good for much, but he dislikes me because I
disagree with him.“</p>
<p>Will was not without his intentions to be always generous, but
our tongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled
before general intentions can be brought to bear. And it was too
intolerable that Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly
accounted for to Dorothea. Yet when he had spoken he was rather
uneasy as to the effect on her.</p>
<p>But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as
she had been on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep.
She was no longer struggling against the perception of facts, but
adjusting herself to their clearest perception; and now when she
looked steadily at her husband’s failure, still more at his
possible consciousness of failure, she seemed to be looking along
the one track where duty became tenderness. Will’s want of
reticence might have been met with more severity, if he had not
already been recommended to her mercy by her husband’s dislike,
which must seem hard to her till she saw better reason for it.</p>
<p>She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly
she said, with some earnestness, “Mr. Casaubon must have overcome
his dislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that
is admirable.”</p>
<p>“Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was
an abominable thing that my grandmother should have been
disinherited because she made what they called a mesalliance,
though there was nothing to be said against her husband except that
he was a Polish refugee who gave lessons for his bread.”</p>
<p>“I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she
bore the change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was
happy with her husband! Do you know much about them?”</p>
<p>“No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright
fellow—could speak many languages—musical—got his bread by teaching
all sorts of things. They both died rather early. And I never knew
much of my father, beyond what my mother told me; but he inherited
the musical talents. I remember his slow walk and his long thin
hands; and one day remains with me when he was lying ill, and I was
very hungry, and had only a little bit of bread.”</p>
<p>“Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen
interest, clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too
much of everything. But tell me how it was—Mr. Casaubon could not
have known about you then.”</p>
<p>“No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and
that was my last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my
mother and I were well taken care of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly
recognized it as his duty to take care of us because of the harsh
injustice which had been shown to his mother’s sister. But now I am
telling you what is not new to you.”</p>
<p>In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell
Dorothea what was rather new even in his own construction of
things—namely, that Mr. Casaubon had never done more than pay a
debt towards him. Will was much too good a fellow to be easy under
the sense of being ungrateful. And when gratitude has become a
matter of reasoning there are many ways of escaping from its
bonds.</p>
<p>“No,“ answered Dorothea; ”Mr. Casaubon has always avoided
dwelling on his own honorable actions.“ She did not feel that her
husband’s conduct was depreciated; but this notion of what justice
had required in his relations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold
on her mind. After a moment’s pause, she added, ”He had never told
me that he supported your mother. Is she still living?“</p>
<p>“No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is
curious that my mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for
the sake of her husband. She never would tell me anything about her
family, except that she forsook them to get her own living—went on
the stage, in fact. She was a dark-eyed creature, with crisp
ringlets, and never seemed to be getting old. You see I come of
rebellious blood on both sides,” Will ended, smiling brightly at
Dorothea, while she was still looking with serious intentness
before her, like a child seeing a drama for the first time.</p>
<p>But her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your
apology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I
mean, to Mr. Casaubon’s wishes. You must remember that you have not
done what he thought best for you. And if he dislikes you—you were
speaking of dislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if
he has shown any painful feelings towards you, you must consider
how sensitive he has become from the wearing effect of study.
Perhaps,” she continued, getting into a pleading tone, “my uncle
has not told you how serious Mr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would
be very petty of us who are well and can bear things, to think much
of small offences from those who carry a weight of trial.”</p>
<p>“You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that
subject again.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from
the unutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly
conscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure
pity and loyalty towards her husband. Will was ready to adore her
pity and loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in
manifesting them. “I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,”
he went on, “but I will never again, if I can help it, do or say
what you would disapprove.”</p>
<p>“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open
smile. “I shall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give
laws. But you will soon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You
will soon be tired of staying at the Grange.”</p>
<p>“That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons
why I wished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I
should stay in this neighborhood. He has bought one of the
Middlemarch newspapers, and he wishes me to conduct that, and also
to help him in other ways.”</p>
<p>“Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?”
said Dorothea.</p>
<p>“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of
prospects, and not settling to anything. And here is something
offered to me. If you would not like me to accept it, I will give
it up. Otherwise I would rather stay in this part of the country
than go away. I belong to nobody anywhere else.”</p>
<p>“I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once,
as simply and readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the
shadow of a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say
so.</p>
<p>“Then I <i>will</i> stay," said Ladislaw, shaking his head
backward, rising and going towards the window, as if to see whether
the rain had ceased.</p>
<p>But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was
getting continually stronger, began to reflect that her husband
felt differently from herself, and she colored deeply under the
double embarrassment of having expressed what might be in
opposition to her husband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this
opposition to Will. If is face was not turned towards her, and this
made it easier to say—</p>
<p>“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I
think you should be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without
thinking of anything else than my own feeling, which has nothing to
do with the real question. But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr.
Casaubon might see that the proposal was not wise. Can you not wait
now and mention it to him?”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the
possibility that Mr. Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over
now. I told Mr. Brooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the
five miles. I shall strike across Halsell Common, and see the
gleams on the wet grass. I like that.”</p>
<p>He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but
not daring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No,
he dared not, could not say it. To ask her to be less simple and
direct would be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see
the light through. And there was always the other great dread—of
himself becoming dimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of
mournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand. She also had her
thought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to
lose no time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to
urge this might seem an undue dictation.</p>
<p>So they only said “Good-by,“ and Will quitted the house,
striking across the fields so as not to run any risk of
encountering Mr. Casaubon’s carriage, which, however, did not
appear at the gate until four o’clock. That was an unpropitious
hour for coming home: it was too early to gain the moral support
under ennui of dressing his person for dinner, and too late to
undress his mind of the day’s frivolous ceremony and affairs, so as
to be prepared for a good plunge into the serious business of
study. On such occasions he usually threw into an easy-chair in the
library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London papers to him,
closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined that
relief, observing that he had already had too many public details
urged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when
Dorothea asked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal
effort which never forsook him even when he spoke without his
waistcoat and cravat—</p>
<p>“I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance,
Dr. Spanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a
worthy recipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late
tractate on the Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it
would not become me to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr.
Casaubon leaned over the elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up
and down, apparently as a muscular outlet instead of that
recapitulation which would not have been becoming.</p>
<p>“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea,
delighted to see her husband less weary than usual at this hour.
“Before you came I had been regretting that you happened to be out
to-day.”</p>
<p>“Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward
again.</p>
<p>“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a
proposal of my uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion
of.” Her husband she felt was really concerned in this question.
Even with her ignorance of the world she had a vague impression
that the position offered to Will was out of keeping with his
family connections, and certainly Mr. Casaubon had a claim to be
consulted. He did not speak, but merely bowed.</p>
<p>“Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has
bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr.
Ladislaw to stay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for
him, besides helping him in other ways.”</p>
<p>Dorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at
first blinked and finally closed his eyes, as if to save them;
while his lips became more tense. “What is your opinion?” she
added, rather timidly, after a slight pause.</p>
<p>“Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr.
Casaubon, opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at
Dorothea. She was really uncomfortable on the point he inquired
about, but she only became a little more serious, and her eyes did
not swerve.</p>
<p>“No,“ she answered immediately, ”he did not say that he came to
ask your opinion. But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course
expected me to tell you of it.“</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon was silent.</p>
<p>“I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a
young man with so much talent might be very useful to my
uncle—might help him to do good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw
wishes to have some fixed occupation. He has been blamed, he says,
for not seeking something of that kind, and he would like to stay
in this neighborhood because no one cares for him elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her
husband. However, he did not speak, and she presently recurred to
Dr. Spanning and the Archdeacon’s breakfast. But there was no
longer sunshine on these subjects.</p>
<p>The next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon
despatched the following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he
had always before addressed him as “Will“):—</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="letter">“Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has
been made to you, and (according to an inference by no means
stretched) has on your part been in some degree entertained, which
involves your residence in this neighborhood in a capacity which I
am justified in saying touches my own position in such a way as
renders it not only natural and warrantable in me when that effect
is viewed under the influence of legitimate feeling, but incumbent
on me when the same effect is considered in the light of my
responsibilities, to state at once that your acceptance of the
proposal above indicated would be highly offensive to me. That I
have some claim to the exercise of a veto here, would not, I
believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of the
relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past
by your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their
character of determining antecedents. I will not here make
reflections on any person’s judgment. It is enough for me to point
out to yourself that there are certain social fitnesses and
proprieties which should hinder a somewhat near relative of mine
from becoming any wise conspicuous in this vicinity in a status not
only much beneath my own, but associated at best with the sciolism
of literary or political adventurers. At any rate, the contrary
issue must exclude you from further reception at my house.</p>
<p class="closing">Yours faithfully,<br/>
    "EDWARD CASAUBON."<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the
further embitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that
grew to agitation, on what Will had told her about his parents and
grandparents. Any private hours in her day were usually spent in
her blue-green boudoir, and she had come to be very fond of its
pallid quaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but
while the summer had gradually advanced over the western fields
beyond the avenue of elms, the bare room had gathered within it
those memories of an inward life which fill the air as with a cloud
of good or bad angels, the invisible yet active forms of our
spiritual triumphs or our spiritual falls. She had been so used to
struggle for and to find resolve in looking along the avenue
towards the arch of western light that the vision itself had gained
a communicating power. Even the pale stag seemed to have reminding
glances and to mean mutely, “Yes, we know.” And the group of
delicately touched miniatures had made an audience as of beings no
longer disturbed about their own earthly lot, but still humanly
interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia” about whom
Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband.</p>
<p>And now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had
gathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the
presence of that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she
knew, helping to concentrate her feelings. What a wrong, to cut off
the girl from the family protection and inheritance only because
she had chosen a man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her
elders with questions about the facts around her, had wrought
herself into some independent clearness as to the historical,
political reasons why eldest sons had superior rights, and why land
should be entailed: those reasons, impressing her with a certain
awe, might be weightier than she knew, but here was a question of
ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a daughter whose
child—even according to the ordinary aping of aristocratic
institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than retired
grocers, and who have no more land to “keep together” than a lawn
and a paddock—would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a question
of liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea’s nature
went on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded
on our own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.</p>
<p>It was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt
to the Ladislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had
been wronged of. And now she began to think of her husband’s will,
which had been made at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk
of his property to her, with proviso in case of her having
children. That ought to be altered; and no time ought to be lost.
This very question which had just arisen about Will Ladislaw’s
occupation, was the occasion for placing things on a new, right
footing. Her husband, she felt sure, according to all his previous
conduct, would be ready to take the just view, if she proposed
it—she, in whose interest an unfair concentration of the property
had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and would
continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She
suspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon,
and this made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh
understanding should be begun, so that instead of Will’s starting
penniless and accepting the first function that offered itself, he
should find himself in possession of a rightful income which should
be paid by her husband during his life, and, by an immediate
alteration of the will, should be secured at his death. The vision
of all this as what ought to be done seemed to Dorothea like a
sudden letting in of daylight, waking her from her previous
stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance about her husband’s
relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr. Casaubon’s future
aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her; and Mr.
Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon him.
“But he will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character
lies here. And what are we doing with our money? We make no use of
half of our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy
conscience.”</p>
<p>There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division
of property intended for herself, and always regarded by her as
excessive. She was blind, you see, to many things obvious to
others—likely to tread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned
her; yet her blindness to whatever did not lie in her own pure
purpose carried her safely by the side of precipices where vision
would have been perilous with fear.</p>
<p>The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her
boudoir occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr.
Casaubon had sent his letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance
to her till she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to
her husband. To his preoccupied mind all subjects were to be
approached gently, and she had never since his illness lost from
her consciousness the dread of agitating him. Bat when young ardor
is set brooding over the conception of a prompt deed, the deed
itself seems to start forth with independent life, mastering ideal
obstacles. The day passed in a sombre fashion, not unusual, though
Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent; but there were hours of
the night which might be counted on as opportunities of
conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her husband’s
sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a
candle, and reading him to sleep again. And this night she was from
the beginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He slept as usual for
a few hours, but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness
for nearly an hour before he said—</p>
<p>“Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”</p>
<p>“Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed
him.</p>
<p>“No, not at all; but I shall be obliged, since you are up, if
you will read me a few pages of Lowth.”</p>
<p>“May I talk to you a little instead?” said Dorothea.</p>
<p>“Certainly.“</p>
<p>“I have been thinking about money all day—that I have always had
too much, and especially the prospect of too much.”</p>
<p>“These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.”</p>
<p>“But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged,
it seems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that
wrong right must be obeyed.”</p>
<p>“What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?”</p>
<p>“That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me—I mean,
with regard to property; and that makes me unhappy.”</p>
<p>“How so? I have none but comparatively distant connections.”</p>
<p>“I have been led to think about your aunt Julia, and how she was
left in poverty only because she married a poor man, an act which
was not disgraceful, since he was not unworthy. It was on that
ground, I know, that you educated Mr. Ladislaw and provided for his
mother.”</p>
<p>Dorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help
her onward. None came, and her next words seemed the more forcible
to her, falling clear upon the dark silence.</p>
<p>“But surely we should regard his claim as a much greater one,
even to the half of that property which I know that you have
destined for me. And I think he ought at once to be provided for on
that understanding. It is not right that he should be in the
dependence of poverty while we are rich. And if there is any
objection to the proposal he mentioned, the giving him his true
place and his true share would set aside any motive for his
accepting it.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ladislaw has probably been speaking to you on this
subject?” said Mr. Casaubon, with a certain biting quickness not
habitual to him.</p>
<p>“Indeed, no!” said Dorothea, earnestly. “How can you imagine it,
since he has so lately declined everything from you? I fear you
think too hardly of him, dear. He only told me a little about his
parents and grandparents, and almost all in answer to my questions.
You are so good, so just—you have done everything you thought to be
right. But it seems to me clear that more than that is right; and I
must speak about it, since I am the person who would get what is
called benefit by that ’more’ not being done.”</p>
<p>There was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied, not
quickly as before, but with a still more biting emphasis.</p>
<p>“Dorothea, my love, this is not the first occasion, but it were
well that it should be the last, on which you have assumed a
judgment on subjects beyond your scope. Into the question how far
conduct, especially in the matter of alliances, constitutes a
forfeiture of family claims, I do not now enter. Suffice it, that
you are not here qualified to discriminate. What I now wish you to
understand is, that I accept no revision, still less dictation
within that range of affairs which I have deliberated upon as
distinctly and properly mine. It is not for you to interfere
between me and Mr. Ladislaw, and still less to encourage
communications from him to you which constitute a criticism on my
procedure.”</p>
<p>Poor Dorothea, shrouded in the darkness, was in a tumult of
conflicting emotions. Alarm at the possible effect on himself of
her husband’s strongly manifested anger, would have checked any
expression of her own resentment, even if she had been quite free
from doubt and compunction under the consciousness that there might
be some justice in his last insinuation. Hearing him breathe
quickly after he had spoken, she sat listening, frightened,
wretched—with a dumb inward cry for help to bear this nightmare of
a life in which every energy was arrested by dread. But nothing
else happened, except that they both remained a long while
sleepless, without speaking again.</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Casaubon received the following answer from
Will Ladislaw:—</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="letter">“DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I have given all due
consideration to your letter of yesterday, but I am unable to take
precisely your view of our mutual position. With the fullest
acknowledgment of your generous conduct to me in the past, I must
still maintain that an obligation of this kind cannot fairly fetter
me as you appear to expect that it should. Granted that a
benefactor’s wishes may constitute a claim; there must always be a
reservation as to the quality of those wishes. They may possibly
clash with more imperative considerations. Or a benefactor’s veto
might impose such a negation on a man’s life that the consequent
blank might be more cruel than the benefaction was generous. I am
merely using strong illustrations. In the present case I am unable
to take your view of the bearing which my acceptance of
occupation—not enriching certainly, but not dishonorable—will have
on your own position which seems to me too substantial to be
affected in that shadowy manner. And though I do not believe that
any change in our relations will occur (certainly none has yet
occurred) which can nullify the obligations imposed on me by the
past, pardon me for not seeing that those obligations should
restrain me from using the ordinary freedom of living where I
choose, and maintaining myself by any lawful occupation I may
choose. Regretting that there exists this difference between us as
to a relation in which the conferring of benefits has been entirely
on your side—</p>
<p class="closing">I remain, yours with persistent
obligation,<br/>
    WILL LADISLAW."<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Poor Mr. Casaubon felt (and must not we, being impartial, feel
with him a little?) that no man had juster cause for disgust and
suspicion than he. Young Ladislaw, he was sure, meant to defy and
annoy him, meant to win Dorothea’s confidence and sow her mind with
disrespect, and perhaps aversion, towards her husband. Some motive
beneath the surface had been needed to account for Will’s sudden
change of in rejecting Mr. Casaubon’s aid and quitting his travels;
and this defiant determination to fix himself in the neighborhood
by taking up something so much at variance with his former choice
as Mr. Brooke’s Middlemarch projects, revealed clearly enough that
the undeclared motive had relation to Dorothea. Not for one moment
did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any doubleness: he had no
suspicions of her, but he had (what was little less uncomfortable)
the positive knowledge that her tendency to form opinions about her
husband’s conduct was accompanied with a disposition to regard Will
Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he said. His own proud
reticence had prevented him from ever being undeceived in the
supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her uncle to invite
Will to his house.</p>
<p>And now, on receiving Will’s letter, Mr. Casaubon had to
consider his duty. He would never have been easy to call his action
anything else than duty; but in this case, contending motives
thrust him back into negations.</p>
<p>Should he apply directly to Mr. Brooke, and demand of that
troublesome gentleman to revoke his proposal? Or should he consult
Sir James Chettam, and get him to concur in remonstrance against a
step which touched the whole family? In either case Mr. Casaubon
was aware that failure was just as probable as success. It was
impossible for him to mention Dorothea’s name in the matter, and
without some alarming urgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not,
after meeting all representations with apparent assent, to wind up
by saying, “Never fear, Casaubon! Depend upon it, young Ladislaw
will do you credit. Depend upon it, I have put my finger on the
right thing.” And Mr. Casaubon shrank nervously from communicating
on the subject with Sir James Chettam, between whom and himself
there had never been any cordiality, and who would immediately
think of Dorothea without any mention of her.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody’s feeling towards
him, especially as a husband. To let any one suppose that he was
jealous would be to admit their (suspected) view of his
disadvantages: to let them know that he did not find marriage
particularly blissful would imply his conversion to their
(probably) earlier disapproval. It would be as bad as letting Carp,
and Brasenose generally, know how backward he was in organizing the
matter for his “Key to all Mythologies.” All through his life Mr.
Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to himself the inward
sores of self-doubt and jealousy. And on the most delicate of all
personal subjects, the habit of proud suspicious reticence told
doubly.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly, bitterly silent. But he had
forbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor, and he was mentally
preparing other measures of frustration.</p>
