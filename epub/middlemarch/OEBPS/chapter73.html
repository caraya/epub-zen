<blockquote><p>
        Pity the laden one; this wandering woe
        May visit you and me.
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode's anxiety by telling her
that her husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting, but
that he trusted soon to see him better and would call again the
next day, unless she-sent for him earlier, he went directly home,
got on his horse, and rode three miles out of the town for the sake
of being out of reach.</p>
<p>He felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging
under the pain of stings: he was ready to curse the day on which he
had come to Middlemarch. Everything that bad happened to him there
seemed a mere preparation for this hateful fatality, which had come
as a blight on his honorable ambition, and must make even people
who had only vulgar standards regard his reputation as irrevocably
damaged. In such moments a man can hardly escape being unloving.
Lydgate thought of himself as the sufferer, and of others as the
agents who had injured his lot. He had meant everything to turn out
differently; and others had thrust themselves into his life and
thwarted his purposes. His marriage seemed an unmitigated calamity;
and he was afraid of going to Rosamond before he had vented himself
in this solitary rage, lest the mere sight of her should exasperate
him and make him behave unwarrantably. There are episodes in most
men’s lives in which their highest qualities can only cast a
deterring shadow over the objects that fill their inward vision:
Lydgate’s tenderheartedness was present just then only as a dread
lest he should offend against it, not as an emotion that swayed him
to tenderness. For he was very miserable. Only those who know the
supremacy of the intellectual life—the life which has a seed of
ennobling thought and purpose within it—can understand the grief of
one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing
soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances.</p>
<p>How was he to live on without vindicating himself among people
who suspected him of baseness? How could he go silently away from
Middlemarch as if he were retreating before a just condemnation?
And yet how was he to set about vindicating himself?</p>
<p>For that scene at the meeting, which he had just witnessed,
although it had told him no particulars, had been enough to make
his own situation thoroughly clear to him. Bulstrode had been in
dread of scandalous disclosures on the part of Raffles. Lydgate
could now construct all the probabilities of the case. “He was
afraid of some betrayal in my hearing: all he wanted was to bind me
to him by a strong obligation: that was why he passed on a sudden
from hardness to liberality. And he may have tampered with the
patient—he may have disobeyed my orders. I fear he did. But whether
he did or not, the world believes that he somehow or other poisoned
the man and that I winked at the crime, if I didn’t help in it. And
yet—and yet he may not be guilty of the last offence; and it is
just possible that the change towards me may have been a genuine
relenting—the effect of second thoughts such as he alleged. What we
call the ’just possible’ is sometimes true and the thing we find it
easier to believe is grossly false. In his last dealings with this
man Bulstrode may have kept his hands pure, in spite of my
suspicion to the contrary.”</p>
<p>There was a benumbing cruelty in his position. Even if he
renounced every other consideration than that of justifying
himself—if he met shrugs, cold glances, and avoidance as an
accusation, and made a public statement of all the facts as he knew
them, who would be convinced? It would be playing the part of a
fool to offer his own testimony on behalf of himself, and say, “I
did not take the money as a bribe.” The circumstances would always
be stronger than his assertion. And besides, to come forward and
tell everything about himself must include declarations about
Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of others against him.
He must tell that he had not known of Raffles’s existence when he
first mentioned his pressing need of money to Bulstrode, and that
he took the money innocently as a result of that communication, not
knowing that a new motive for the loan might have arisen on his
being called in to this man. And after all, the suspicion of
Bulstrode’s motives might be unjust.</p>
<p>But then came the question whether he should have acted in
precisely the same way if he had not taken the money? Certainly, if
Raffles had continued alive and susceptible of further treatment
when he arrived, and he had then imagined any disobedience to his
orders on the part of Bulstrode, he would have made a strict
inquiry, and if his conjecture had been verified he would have
thrown up the case, in spite of his recent heavy obligation. But if
he had not received any money—if Bulstrode had never revoked his
cold recommendation of bankruptcy—would he, Lydgate, have abstained
from all inquiry even on finding the man dead?—would the shrinking
from an insult to Bulstrode—would the dubiousness of all medical
treatment and the argument that his own treatment would pass for
the wrong with most members of his profession—have had just the
same force or significance with him?</p>
<p>That was the uneasy corner of Lydgate’s consciousness while he
was reviewing the facts and resisting all reproach. If he had been
independent, this matter of a patient’s treatment and the distinct
rule that he must do or see done that which he believed best for
the life committed to him, would have been the point on which he
would have been the sturdiest. As it was, he had rested in the
consideration that disobedience to his orders, however it might
have arisen, could not be considered a crime, that in the dominant
opinion obedience to his orders was just as likely to be fatal, and
that the affair was simply one of etiquette. Whereas, again and
again, in his time of freedom, he had denounced the perversion of
pathological doubt into moral doubt and had said—“the purest
experiment in treatment may still be conscientious: my business is
to take care of life, and to do the best I can think of for it.
Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma. Dogma gives a
charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a contest
with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.” Alas! the
scientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money
obligation and selfish respects.</p>
<p>“Is there a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would
question himself as I do?” said poor Lydgate, with a renewed
outburst of rebellion against the oppression of his lot. “And yet
they will all feel warranted in making a wide space between me and
them, as if I were a leper! My practice and my reputation are
utterly damned—I can see that. Even if I could be cleared by valid
evidence, it would make little difference to the blessed world
here. I have been set down as tainted and should be cheapened to
them all the same.”</p>
<p>Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled
him, that just when he had been paying off his debts and getting
cheerfully on his feet, the townsmen were avoiding him or looking
strangely at him, and in two instances it came to his knowledge
that patients of his had called in another practitioner. The
reasons were too plain now. The general black-balling had
begun.</p>
<p>No wonder that in Lydgate’s energetic nature the sense of a
hopeless misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance.
The scowl which occasionally showed itself on his square brow was
not a meaningless accident. Already when he was re-entering the
town after that ride taken in the first hours of stinging pain, he
was setting his mind on remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the
worst that could be done against him. He would not retreat before
calumny, as if he submitted to it. He would face it to the utmost,
and no act of his should show that he was afraid. It belonged to
the generosity as well as defiant force of his nature that he
resolved not to shrink from showing to the full his sense of
obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association with this
man had been fatal to him—true that if he had had the thousand
pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would have
returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the
rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for,
remember, he was one of the proudest among the sons of
men)—nevertheless, he would not turn away from this crushed
fellow-mortal whose aid he had used, and make a pitiful effort to
get acquittal for himself by howling against another. “I shall do
as I think right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me
out, but—” he was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he was
getting near home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again
into that chief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized
struggles of wounded honor and pride.</p>
<p>How would Rosamond take it all? Here was another weight of chain
to drag, and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing her dumb
mastery. He had no impulse to tell her the trouble which must soon
be common to them both. He preferred waiting for the incidental
disclosure which events must soon bring about.</p>
