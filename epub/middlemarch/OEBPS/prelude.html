<p>Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the
mysterious mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time,
has not dwelt, at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has
not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl
walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller
brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out
they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as
two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national
idea; until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and
turned them back from their great resolve. That child-pilgrimage
was a fit beginning. Theresa’s passionate, ideal nature demanded an
epic life: what were many-volumed romances of chivalry and the
social conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her flame quickly
burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within, soared after some
illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify
weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous
consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the reform
of a religious order.</p>
<p>That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was
certainly not the last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born
who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant
unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes,
the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the
meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no
sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and
tangled circumstance they tried to shape their thought and deed in
noble agreement; but after all, to common eyes their struggles
seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness; for these later-born
Theresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which
could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing
soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague ideal and the common
yearning of womanhood; so that the one was disapproved as
extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.</p>
<p>Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the
inconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has
fashioned the natures of women: if there were one level of feminine
incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more,
the social lot of women might be treated with scientific certitude.
Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of variation
are really much wider than any one would imagine from the sameness
of women’s coiffure and the favorite love-stories in prose and
verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared uneasily among the
ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the living stream in
fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and there is born a
Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving heart-beats and
sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed
among hindrances, instead of centring in some long-recognizable
deed.</p>
