<blockquote><p>
         Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:
         We are but mortals, and must sing of man.
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">An</span> eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even
your ugly furniture by lifting it into the serene light of science,
has shown me this pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or
extensive surface of polished steel made to be rubbed by a
housemaid, will be minutely and multitudinously scratched in all
directions; but place now against it a lighted candle as a centre
of illumination, and lo! the scratches will seem to arrange
themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round that little
sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going everywhere
impartially and it is only your candle which produces the
flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling
with an exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable.
The scratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any
person now absent—of Miss Vincy, for example. Rosamond had a
Providence of her own who had kindly made her more charming than
other girls, and who seemed to have arranged Fred's illness and Mr.
Wrench's mistake in order to bring her and Lydgate within effective
proximity. It would have been to contravene these arrangements if
Rosamond had consented to go away to Stone Court or elsewhere, as
her parents wished her to do, especially since Mr. Lydgate thought
the precaution needless. Therefore, while Miss Morgan and the
children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning after Fred's
illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave papa and
mamma.</p>
<p>Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of
woman; and Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on
her account than on Fred’s. But for his insistence she would have
taken no rest: her brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her
costume which had always been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick
bird with languid eye and plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the
sights and sounds that used most to interest her. Fred’s delirium,
in which he seemed to be wandering out of her reach, tore her
heart. After her first outburst against-Mr. Wrench she went about
very quietly: her one low cry was to Lydgate. She would follow him
out of the room and put her hand on his arm moaning out, “Save my
boy.” Once she pleaded, “He has always been good to me, Mr.
Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,”—as if poor
Fred’s suffering were an accusation against him. All the deepest
fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man whose
voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the
babe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was
born.</p>
<p>“I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,” Lydgate would say. “Come down
with me and let us talk about the food.” In that way he led her to
the parlor where Rosamond was, and made a change for her,
surprising her into taking some tea or broth which had been
prepared for her. There was a constant understanding between him
and Rosamond on these matters. He almost always saw her before
going to the sickroom, and she appealed to him as to what she could
do for mamma. Her presence of mind and adroitness in carrying out
his hints were admirable, and it is not wonderful that the idea of
seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with his interest in the
case. Especially when the critical stage was passed, and he began
to feel confident of Fred’s recovery. In the more doubtful time, he
had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could, would rather
have remained neutral on Wrench’s account); but after two
consultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and
there was every reason to make him assiduous. Morning and evening
he was at Mr. Vincy’s, and gradually the visits became cheerful as
Fred became simply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost
petting but conscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after
all, the illness had made a festival for her tenderness.</p>
<p>Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits,
when old Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that
Fred-must make haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could
not do without him, and missed his visits sadly. The old man
himself was getting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to
Fred when he could listen, and he turned towards her his delicate,
pinched face, from which all the thick blond hair had been cut
away, and in which the eyes seemed to have got larger, yearning for
some word about Mary—wondering what she felt about his illness. No
word passed his lips; but “to hear with eyes belongs to love’s rare
wit,” and the mother in the fulness of her heart not only divined
Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any sacrifice in order to
satisfy him.</p>
<p>“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving
folly; “and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can
marry anybody he likes then.”</p>
<p>“Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred. The illness had
made him childish, and tears came as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, secretly
incredulous of any such refusal.</p>
<p>She never left Fred’s side when her husband was not in the
house, and thus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much
alone. Lydgate, naturally, never thought of staying long with her,
yet it seemed that the brief impersonal conversations they had
together were creating that peculiar intimacy which consists in
shyness. They were obliged to look at each other in speaking, and
somehow the looking could not be carried through as the matter of
course which it really was. Lydgate began to feel this sort of
consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or anywhere, like
an ill-worked puppet. But this turned out badly: the next day,
Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when their eyes
met again, both were more conscious than before. There was no help
for this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there
seemed to be no help for it in folly. It was therefore a relief
when neighbors no longer considered the house in quarantine, and
when the chances of seeing Rosamond alone were very much
reduced.</p>
<p>But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels
that the other is feeling something, having once existed, its
effect is not to be done away with. Talk about the weather and
other well-bred topics is apt to seem a hollow device, and behavior
can hardly become easy unless it frankly recognizes a mutual
fascination—which of course need not mean anything deep or serious.
This was the way in which Rosamond and Lydgate slid gracefully into
ease, and made their intercourse lively again. Visitors came and
went as usual, there was once more music in the drawing-room, and
all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy’s mayoralty returned.
Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by Rosamond’s side, and
lingered to hear her music, calling himself her captive—meaning,
all the while, not to be her captive. The preposterousness of the
notion that he could at once set up a satisfactory establishment as
a married man was a sufficient guarantee against danger. This play
at being a little in love was agreeable, and did not interfere with
graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all, was not necessarily a
singeing process. Rosamond, for her part, had never enjoyed the
days so much in her life before: she was sure of being admired by
some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish flirtation
from love, either in herself or in another. She seemed to be
sailing with a fair wind just whither she would go, and her
thoughts were much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate
which she hoped would by-and-by be vacant. She was quite
determined, when she was married, to rid herself adroitly of all
the visitors who were not agreeable to her at her father’s; and she
imagined the drawing-room in her favorite house with various styles
of furniture.</p>
<p>Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself;
he seemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that
his enchantment under her music had been less like an emotional
elephant’s, and if he had been able to discriminate better the
refinements of her taste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned
a deficiency in him. How different he was from young Plymdale or
Mr. Caius Larcher! Those young men had not a notion of French, and
could speak on no subject with striking knowledge, except perhaps
the dyeing and carrying trades, which of course they were ashamed
to mention; they were Middlemarch gentry, elated with their
silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but embarrassed in their
manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above them, having at
least the accent and manner of a university man. Whereas Lydgate
was always listened to, bore himself with the careless politeness
of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right clothes on
by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think about
them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he
approached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious
sense that she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had
been aware of all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he
might have been just as well pleased as any other man, even the
most densely ignorant of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he
held it one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine mind to
adore a man’s pre-eminence without too precise a knowledge of what
it consisted in. But Rosamond was not one of those helpless girls
who betray themselves unawares, and whose behavior is awkwardly
driven by their impulses, instead of being steered by wary grace
and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid forecast and
rumination concerning house-furniture and society were ever
discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the
contrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and
disapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been
detected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have
disbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any
unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct
sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private
album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made
the irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no
unfair evil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid
or mercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as
something necessary which other people would always provide. She
was not in the habit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements
were no direct clew to fact, why, they were not intended in that
light—they were among her elegant accomplishments, intended to
please. Nature had inspired many arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s
favorite pupil, who by general consent (Fred’s excepted) was a rare
compound of beauty, cleverness, and amiability.</p>
<p>Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her, and
there was no constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of
influence in their eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of
meaning for them, which is observable with some sense of flatness
by a third person; still they had no interviews or asides from
which a third person need have been excluded. In fact, they
flirted; and Lydgate was secure in the belief that they did nothing
else. If a man could not love and be wise, surely he could flirt
and be wise at the same time? Really, the men in Middlemarch,
except Mr. Farebrother, were great bores, and Lydgate did not care
about commercial politics or cards: what was he to do for
relaxation? He was often invited to the Bulstrodes’; but the girls
there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and Mrs. Bulstrode’s
<i>naive</i> way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the
nothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the
consciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a
sufficient relief from the weight of her husband's invariable
seriousness. The Vincys' house, with all its faults, was the
pleasanter by contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond—sweet to
look at as a half-opened blush-rose, and adorned with
accomplishments for the refined amusement of man.</p>
<p>But he made some enemies, other than medical, by his success
with Miss Vincy. One evening he came into the drawing-room rather
late, when several other visitors were there. The card-table had
drawn off the elders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches
in Middlemarch, though not one of its leading minds) was in
tete-a-tete with Rosamond. He had brought the last “Keepsake,“ the
gorgeous watered-silk publication which marked modern progress at
that time; and he considered himself very fortunate that he could
be the first to look over it with her, dwelling on the ladies and
gentlemen with shiny copper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles,
and pointing to comic verses as capital and sentimental stories as
interesting. Rosamond was gracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that
he had the very best thing in art and literature as a medium for
”paying addresses“—the very thing to please a nice girl. He had
also reasons, deep rather than ostensible, for being satisfied with
his own appearance. To superficial observers his chin had too
vanishing an aspect, looking as if it were being gradually
reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about the
fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were at that time
useful.</p>
<p>“I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr.
Ned. He kept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked
at it rather languishingly.</p>
<p>“Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said
Rosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young
Plymdale’s hands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She
went on with her tatting all the while.</p>
<p>“I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,” said Mr. Ned,
venturing to look from the portrait to its rival.</p>
<p>“I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,” said Rosamond,
feeling sure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a
second time.</p>
<p>But now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached
Rosamond’s corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on
the other side of her, young Plymdale’s jaw fell like a barometer
towards the cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only
Lydgate’s presence but its effect: she liked to excite
jealousy.</p>
<p>“What a late comer you are!” she said, as they shook hands.
“Mamma had given you up a little while ago. How do you find
Fred?”</p>
<p>“As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him to go away—to
Stone Court, for example. But your mamma seems to have some
objection.”</p>
<p>“Poor fellow!” said Rosamond, prettily. “You will see Fred so
changed,” she added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked
to Mr. Lydgate as our guardian angel during this illness.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake“
towards him and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed
up his chill, as if in wonderment at human folly.</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at so profanely?” said Rosamond, with
bland neutrality.</p>
<p>“I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest—the engravings
or the writing here,” said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone,
while he turned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through
the book in no time, and showing his large white hands to much
advantage, as Rosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom coming
out of church: did you ever see such a ’sugared invention’—as the
Elizabethans used to say? Did any haberdasher ever look so
smirking? Yet I will answer for it the story makes him one of the
first gentlemen in the land.”</p>
<p>“You are so severe, I am frightened at you,” said Rosamond,
keeping her amusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had
lingered with admiration over this very engraving, and his spirit
was stirred.</p>
<p>“There are a great many celebrated people writing in the
’Keepsake,’ at all events,” he said, in a tone at once piqued and
timid. “This is the first time I have heard it called silly.”</p>
<p>“I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a
Goth,” said Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. “I suspect
you know nothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.” Rosamond
herself was not without relish for these writers, but she did not
readily commit herself by admiration, and was alive to the
slightest hint that anything was not, according to Lydgate, in the
very highest taste.</p>
<p>“But Sir Walter Scott—I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,” said
young Plymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.</p>
<p>“Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book,
and pushing it away. “I read so much when I was a lad, that I
suppose it will last me all my life. I used to know Scott’s poems
by heart.”</p>
<p>“I should like to know when you left off,” said Rosamond,
“because then I might be sure that I knew something which you did
not know.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,” said Mr.
Ned, purposely caustic.</p>
<p>“On the contrary,” said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling
with exasperating confidence at Rosamond. “It would be worth
knowing by the fact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”</p>
<p>Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking
that Lydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it
had ever been his ill-fortune to meet.</p>
<p>“How rash you are!” said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. “Do you
see that you have given offence?”</p>
<p>“What! is it Mr. Plymdale’s book? I am sorry. I didn’t think
about it.”</p>
<p>“I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first
came here—that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.”</p>
<p>“Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will. Don’t I
listen to her willingly?”</p>
<p>To Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as
engaged. That they were some time to be engaged had long been an
idea in her mind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of
existence, the necessary materials being at hand. It is true,
Lydgate had the counter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a
mere negative, a shadow east by other resolves which themselves
were capable of shrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on
the side of Rosamond’s idea, which had a shaping activity and
looked through watchful blue eyes, whereas Lydgate’s lay blind and
unconcerned as a jelly-fish which gets melted without knowing
it.</p>
<p>That evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see
how a process of maceration was going on, with undisturbed
interest; and he wrote out his daily notes with as much precision
as usual. The reveries from which it was difficult for him to
detach himself were ideal constructions of something else than
Rosamond’s virtues, and the primitive tissue was still his fair
unknown. Moreover, he was beginning to feel some zest for the
growing though half-suppressed feud between him and the other
medical men, which was likely to become more manifest, now that
Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was about to be
declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his
non-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be
counterbalanced by the impression he had produced in other
quarters. Only a few days later, when he had happened to overtake
Rosamond on the Lowick road and had got down from his horse to walk
by her side until he had quite protected her from a passing drove,
he had been stopped by a servant on horseback with a message
calling him in to a house of some importance where Peacock had
never attended; and it was the second instance of this kind. The
servant was Sir James Chettam’s, and the house was Lowick
Manor.</p>
