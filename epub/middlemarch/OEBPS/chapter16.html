<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried
chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the
Middlemarchers; and Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw
much light on the power exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The
banker was evidently a ruler, but there was an opposition party,
and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be
seen that their support was a compromise, and who frankly stated
their impression that the general scheme of things, and especially
the casualties of trade, required you to hold a candle to the
devil.</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country
banker, who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town
and could touch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a
beneficence that was at once ready and severe—ready to confer
obligations, and severe in watching the result. He had gathered, as
an industrious man always at his post, a chief share in
administering the town charities, and his private charities were
both minute and abundant. He would take a great deal of pains about
apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and he would watch over
Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype the washerwoman
against Stubbs’s unjust exaction on the score of her drying-ground,
and he would himself-scrutinize a calumny against Mrs. Strype. His
private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire strictly
into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a man
gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as
gratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,
propagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external
means. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power
as possible, that he might use it for the glory of God. He went
through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in
order to adjust his motives, and make clear to himself what God’s
glory required. But, as we have seen, his motives were not always
rightly appreciated. There were many crass minds in Middlemarch
whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump; and
they had a strong suspicion that since Mr. Bulstrode could not
enjoy life in their fashion, eating and drinking so little as he
did, and worreting himself about everything, he must have a sort of
vampire’s feast in the sense of mastery.</p>
<p>The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy’s table when
Lydgate was dining there, and the family connection with Mr.
Bulstrode did not, he observed, prevent some freedom of remark even
on the part of the host himself, though his reasons against the
proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s
sermons, which were all doctrine, and his preference for Mr.
Farebrother, whose sermons were free from that taint. Mr. Vincy
liked well enough the notion of the chaplain’s having a salary,
supposing it were given to Farebrother, who was as good a little
fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher anywhere, and
companionable too.</p>
<p>“What line shall you take, then?” said Mr. Chichely, the
coroner, a great coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy’s.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m precious glad I’m not one of the Directors now. I shall
vote for referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical
Board together. I shall roll some of my responsibility on your
shoulders, Doctor,” said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague,
the senior physician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat
opposite. “You medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black
draught you will prescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?”</p>
<p>“I know little of either,” said Lydgate; “but in general,
appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal
liking. The fittest man for a particular post is not always the
best fellow or the most agreeable. Sometimes, if you wanted to get
a reform, your only way would be to pension off the good fellows
whom everybody is fond of, and put them out of the question.”</p>
<p>Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most “weight,“
though Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more ”penetration,”
divested his large heavy face of all expression, and looked at his
wine-glass while Lydgate was speaking. Whatever was not
problematical and suspected about this young man—for example, a
certain showiness as to foreign ideas, and a disposition to
unsettle what had been settled and forgotten by his elders—was
positively unwelcome to a physician whose standing had been fixed
thirty years before by a treatise on Meningitis, of which at least
one copy marked “own“ was bound in calf. For my part I have some
fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one’s self-satisfaction is an
untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find
deprecated.</p>
<p>Lydgate’s remark, however, did not meet the sense of the
company. Mr. Vincy said, that if he could have <i>his</i> way, he
would not put disagreeable fellows anywhere.</p>
<p>“Hang your reforms!” said Mr. Chichely. “There’s no greater
humbug in the world. You never hear of a reform, but it means some
trick to put in new men. I hope you are not one of the ’Lancet’s’
men, Mr. Lydgate—wanting to take the coronership out of the hands
of the legal profession: your words appear to point that way.”</p>
<p>“I disapprove of Wakley,” interposed Dr. Sprague, “no man more:
he is an ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the
respectability of the profession, which everybody knows depends on
the London Colleges, for the sake of getting some notoriety for
himself. There are men who don’t mind about being kicked blue if
they can only get talked about. But Wakley is right sometimes,” the
Doctor added, judicially. “I could mention one or two points in
which Wakley is in the right.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well,” said Mr. Chichely, “I blame no man for standing up
in favor of his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like
to know how a coroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a
legal training?”</p>
<p>“In my opinion,” said Lydgate, “legal training only makes a man
more incompetent in questions that require knowledge a of another
kind. People talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed
in scales by a blind Justice. No man can judge what is good
evidence on any particular subject, unless he knows that subject
well. A lawyer is no better than an old woman at a post-mortem
examination. How is he to know the action of a poison? You might as
well say that scanning verse will teach you to scan the potato
crops.”</p>
<p>“You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner’s business
to conduct the post-mortem, but only to take the evidence of the
medical witness?” said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn.</p>
<p>“Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,” said
Lydgate. “Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left
to the chance of decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the
coroner ought not to be a man who will believe that strychnine will
destroy the coats of the stomach if an ignorant practitioner
happens to tell him so.”</p>
<p>Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was
his Majesty’s coroner, and ended innocently with the question,
“Don’t you agree with me, Dr. Sprague?”</p>
<p>“To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in
the metropolis,” said the Doctor. “But I hope it will be long
before this part of the country loses the services of my friend
Chichely, even though it might get the best man in our profession
to succeed him. I am sure Vincy will agree with me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,” said
Mr. Vincy, jovially. “And in my opinion, you’re safest with a
lawyer. Nobody can know everything. Most things are ’visitation of
God.’ And as to poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law.
Come, shall we join the ladies?”</p>
<p>Lydgate’s private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the
very coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he
had not meant to be personal. This was one of the difficulties of
moving in good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on
knowledge as a qualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy
had called Lydgate a prig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to
call him prick-eared; especially when, in the drawing-room, he
seemed to be making himself eminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom
he had easily monopolized in a tete-a-tete, since Mrs. Vincy
herself sat at the tea-table. She resigned no domestic function to
her daughter; and the matron’s blooming good-natured face, with the
two volatile pink strings floating from her fine throat, and her
cheery manners to husband and children, was certainly among the
great attractions of the Vincy house—attractions which made it all
the easier to fall in love with the daughter. The tinge of
unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs. Vincy gave more effect
to Rosamond’s refinement, which was beyond what Lydgate had
expected.</p>
<p>Certainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the
impression of refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite
astonishingly right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of
lip and eyelid. And Rosamond could say the right thing; for she was
clever with that sort of cleverness which catches every tone except
the humorous. Happily she never attempted to joke, and this perhaps
was the most decisive mark of her cleverness.</p>
<p>She and Lydgate readily got into conversation. He regretted that
he had not heard her sing the other day at Stone Court. The only
pleasure he allowed himself during the latter part of his stay in
Paris was to go and hear music.</p>
<p>“You have studied music, probably?” said Rosamond.</p>
<p>“No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by
ear; but the music that I don’t know at all, and have no notion
about, delights me—affects me. How stupid the world is that it does
not make more use of such a pleasure within its reach!”</p>
<p>“Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are
hardly any good musicians. I only know two gentlemen who sing at
all well.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic
way, leaving you to fancy the tune—very much as if it were tapped
on a drum?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,” said Rosamond, with one of her
rare smiles. “But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.”</p>
<p>Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the
conversation, in thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment
seeming to be made out of the faintest blue sky, herself so
immaculately blond, as if the petals of some gigantic flower had
just opened and disclosed her; and yet with this infantine
blondness showing so much ready, self-possessed grace. Since he had
had the memory of Laure, Lydgate had lost all taste for large-eyed
silence: the divine cow no longer attracted him, and Rosamond was
her very opposite. But he recalled himself.</p>
<p>“You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”</p>
<p>“I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond.
“Papa is sure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before
you, who have heard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very
little: I have only once been to London. But our organist at St.
Peter’s is a good musician, and I go on studying with him.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what you saw in London.”</p>
<p>“Very little.” (A more naive girl would have said, “Oh,
everything!“ But Rosamond knew better.) ”A few of the ordinary
sights, such as raw country girls are always taken to.“</p>
<p>“Do you call yourself a raw country girl?” said Lydgate, looking
at her with an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made
Rosamond blush with pleasure. But she remained simply serious,
turned her long neck a little, and put up her hand to touch her
wondrous hair-plaits—an habitual gesture with her as pretty as any
movements of a kitten’s paw. Not that Rosamond was in the least
like a kitten: she was a sylph caught young and educated at Mrs.
Lemon’s.</p>
<p>“I assure you my mind is raw,” she said immediately; “I pass at
Middlemarch. I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors. But I
am really afraid of you.”</p>
<p>“An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men,
though her knowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could
teach me a thousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear
if there were any common language between them. Happily, there is a
common language between women and men, and so the bears can get
taught.”</p>
<p>“Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him
from jarring all your nerves,” said Rosamond, moving to the other
side of the room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his
father’s desire, that Rosamond might give them some music, was
parenthetically performing “Cherry Ripe!” with one hand. Able men
who have passed their examinations will do these things sometimes,
not less than the plucked Fred.</p>
<p>“Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make
Mr. Lydgate ill,” said Rosamond. “He has an ear.”</p>
<p>Fred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.</p>
<p>Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, “You
perceive, the bears will not always be taught.”</p>
<p>“Now then, Rosy!” said Fred, springing from the stool and
twisting it upward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment.
“Some good rousing tunes first.”</p>
<p>Rosamond played admirably. Her master at Mrs. Lemon’s school
(close to a county town with a memorable history that had its
relics in church and castle) was one of those excellent musicians
here and there to be found in our provinces, worthy to compare with
many a noted Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful
conditions of musical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant’s
instinct, had seized his manner of playing, and gave forth his
large rendering of noble music with the precision of an echo. It
was almost startling, heard for the first time. A hidden soul
seemed to be flowing forth from Rosamond’s fingers; and so indeed
it was, since souls live on in perpetual echoes, and to all fine
expression there goes somewhere an originating activity, if it be
only that of an interpreter. Lydgate was taken possession of, and
began to believe in her as something exceptional. After all, he
thought, one need not be surprised to find the rare conjunctions of
nature under circumstances apparently unfavorable: come where they
may, they always depend on conditions that are not obvious. He sat
looking at her, and did not rise to pay her any compliments,
leaving that to others, now that his admiration was deepened.</p>
<p>Her singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and
sweet to hear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she sang
“Meet me by moonlight,” and “I’ve been roaming”; for mortals must
share the fashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be
always classical. But Rosamond could also sing “Black-eyed Susan”
with effect, or Haydn’s canzonets, or “Voi, che sapete,” or “Batti,
batti“—she only wanted to know what her audience liked.</p>
<p>Her father looked round at the company, delighting in their
admiration. Her mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with
her youngest little girl on her lap, softly beating the child’s
hand up and down in time to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding
his general scepticism about Rosy, listened to her music with
perfect allegiance, wishing he could do the same thing on his
flute. It was the pleasantest family party that Lydgate had seen
since he came to Middlemarch. The Vincys had the readiness to
enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the belief in life as a
merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most county towns at
that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain suspicion as of
plague-infection over the few amusements which survived in the
provinces. At the Vincys’ there was always whist, and the
card-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly
impatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a
handsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose
black was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray
eyes. He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little
Louisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room
by Miss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and
seeming to condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held
all through the evening. He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of
a promise to come and see him. “I can’t let you off, you know,
because I have some beetles to show you. We collectors feel an
interest in every new man till he has seen all we have to show
him.”</p>
<p>But soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and
saying, “Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah!
you are too young and light for this kind of thing.”</p>
<p>Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were
so painful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable
resort in this certainly not erudite household. He could half
understand it: the good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger,
and the provision for passing the time without any labor of
intelligence, might make the house beguiling to people who had no
particular use for their odd hours.</p>
<p>Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who
was brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often
said, just the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean
to pay many such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the
evenings; and now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he
meant to excuse himself and go.</p>
<p>“You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,” she said,
when the whist-players were settled. “We are very stupid, and you
have been used to something quite different.”</p>
<p>“I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,” said
Lydgate. “But I have noticed that one always believes one’s own
town to be more stupid than any other. I have made up my mind to
take Middlemarch as it comes, and shall be much obliged if the town
will take me in the same way. I have certainly found some charms in
it which are much greater than I had expected.”</p>
<p>“You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is
pleased with those,” said Rosamond, with simplicity.</p>
<p>“No, I mean something much nearer to me.”</p>
<p>Rosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, “Do you
care about dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men
ever dance.”</p>
<p>“I would dance with you if you would allow me.”</p>
<p>“Oh!“ said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. ”I was
only going to say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to
know whether you would feel insulted if you were asked to
come.“</p>
<p>“Not on the condition I mentioned.”</p>
<p>After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving
towards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.
Farebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which
was a striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o’clock
supper was brought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and
there was punch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of
water. He was winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the
renewal of rubbers should end, and Lydgate at last took his
leave.</p>
<p>But as it was not eleven o’clock, he chose to walk in the brisk
air towards the tower of St. Botolph’s, Mr. Farebrother’s church,
which stood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It
was the oldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but
a vicarage worth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard
that, and he wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the
money he won at cards; thinking, “He seems a very pleasant fellow,
but Bulstrode may have his good reasons.” Many things would be
easier to Lydgate if it should turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was
generally justifiable. “What is his religious doctrine to me, if he
carries some good notions along with it? One must use such brains
as are to be found.”</p>
<p>These were actually Lydgate’s first meditations as he walked
away from Mr. Vincy’s, and on this ground I fear that many ladies
will consider him hardly worthy of their attention. He thought of
Rosamond and her music only in the second place; and though, when
her turn came, he dwelt on the image of her for the rest of his
walk, he felt no agitation, and had no sense that any new current
had set into his life. He could not marry yet; he wished not to
marry for several years; and therefore he was not ready to
entertain the notion of being in love with a girl whom he happened
to admire. He did admire Rosamond exceedingly; but that madness
which had once beset him about Laure was not, he thought, likely to
recur in relation to any other woman. Certainly, if falling in love
had been at all in question, it would have been quite safe with a
creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just the kind of
intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined, docile,
lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and
enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of
demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate
felt sure that if ever he married, his wife would have that
feminine radiance, that distinctive womanhood which must be classed
with flowers and music, that sort of beauty which by its very
nature was virtuous, being moulded only for pure and delicate
joys.</p>
<p>But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his
more pressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever,
which he was specially interested in, because he had known Louis in
Paris, and had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to
ascertain the specific differences of typhus and typhoid. He went
home and read far into the smallest hour, bringing a much more
testing vision of details and relations into this pathological
study than he had ever thought it necessary to apply to the
complexities of love and marriage, these being subjects on which he
felt himself amply informed by literature, and that traditional
wisdom which is handed down in the genial conversation of men.
Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave him that delightful
labor of the imagination which is not mere arbitrariness, but the
exercise of disciplined power—combining and constructing with the
clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest obedience to
knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with impartial
Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its own
work.</p>
<p>Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the
strength of their profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap
narration:—reports of very poor talk going on in distant orbs; or
portraits of Lucifer coming down on his bad errands as a large ugly
man with bat’s wings and spurts of phosphorescence; or
exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect life in a diseased
dream. But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate regarded as rather
vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that reveals subtle
actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in that outer
darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the inward
light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing
even the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space. He for
his part had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds
itself able and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention
which is the very eye of research, provisionally framing its object
and correcting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted
to pierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare
human misery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the
first lurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate
poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy
consciousness.</p>
<p>As he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers
in the grate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in
that agreeable afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from
examination of a specific object into a suffusive sense of its
connections with all the rest of our existence—seems, as it were,
to throw itself on its back after vigorous swimming and float with
the repose of unexhausted strength—Lydgate felt a triumphant
delight in his studies, and something like pity for those less
lucky men who were not of his profession.</p>
<p>“If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,” he thought, “I
might have got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and
lived always in blinkers. I should never have been happy in any
profession that did not call forth the highest intellectual strain,
and yet keep me in good warm contact with my neighbors. There is
nothing like the medical profession for that: one can have the
exclusive scientific life that touches the distance and befriend
the old fogies in the parish too. It is rather harder for a
clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.”</p>
<p>This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures
of the evening. They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as
he took up his bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient
smile which is apt to accompany agreeable recollections. He was an
ardent fellow, but at present his ardor was absorbed in love of his
work and in the ambition of making his life recognized as a factor
in the better life of mankind—like other heroes of science who had
nothing but an obscure country practice to begin with.</p>
<p>Poor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! Each lived in a
world of which the other knew nothing. It had not occurred to
Lydgate that he had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond,
who had neither any reason for throwing her marriage into distant
perspective, nor any pathological studies to divert her mind from
that ruminating habit, that inward repetition of looks, words, and
phrases, which makes a large part in the lives of most girls. He
had not meant to look at her or speak to her with more than the
inevitable amount of admiration and compliment which a man must
give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed to him that his
enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for he feared
falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise at her
possession of such accomplishment. But Rosamond had registered
every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of
a preconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the
foreseen development and climax. In Rosamond’s romance it was not
necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of
his serious business in the world: of course, he had a profession
and was clever, as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant
fact about Lydgate was his good birth, which distinguished him from
all Middlemarch admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of
rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial
condition on earth in which she would have nothing to do with
vulgar people, and perhaps at last associate with relatives quite
equal to the county people who looked down on the Middlemarchers.
It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to discern very subtly the
faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had seen the Miss Brookes
accompanying their uncle at the county assizes, and seated among
the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding their plain
dress.</p>
<p>If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of
family could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do
with the sense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use
your power of comparison a little more effectively, and consider
whether red cloth and epaulets have never had an influence of that
sort. Our passions do not live apart in locked chambers, but,
dressed in their small wardrobe of notions, bring their provisions
to a common table and mess together, feeding out of the common
store according to their appetite.</p>
<p>Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with
Tertius Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her;
and it was excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all
young men might, could, would be, or actually were in love with
her, to believe at once that Lydgate could be no exception. His
looks and words meant more to her than other men’s, because she
cared more for them: she thought of them diligently, and diligently
attended to that perfection of appearance, behavior, sentiments,
and all other elegancies, which would find in Lydgate a more
adequate admirer than she had yet been conscious of.</p>
<p>For Rosamond, though she would never do anything that was
disagreeable to her, was industrious; and now more than ever she
was active in sketching her landscapes and market-carts and
portraits of friends, in practising her music, and in being from
morning till night her own standard of a perfect lady, having
always an audience in her own consciousness, with sometimes the not
unwelcome addition of a more variable external audience in the
numerous visitors of the house. She found time also to read the
best novels, and even the second best, and she knew much poetry by
heart. Her favorite poem was “Lalla Rookh.”</p>
<p>“The best girl in the world! He will be a happy fellow who gets
her!” was the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the
Vincys; and the rejected young men thought of trying again, as is
the fashion in country towns where the horizon is not thick with
coming rivals. But Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been
educated to a ridiculous pitch, for what was the use of
accomplishments which would be all laid aside as soon as she was
married? While her aunt Bulstrode, who had a sisterly faithfulness
towards her brother’s family, had two sincere wishes for
Rosamond—that she might show a more serious turn of mind, and that
she might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her
habits.</p>
