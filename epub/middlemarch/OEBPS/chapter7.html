<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">Mr.</span> Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his
time at the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which
courtship occasioned to the progress of his great work—the Key to
all Mythologies—naturally made him look forward the more eagerly to
the happy termination of courtship. But he had deliberately
incurred the hindrance, having made up his mind that it was now
time for him to adorn his life with the graces of female
companionship, to irradiate the gloom which fatigue was apt to hang
over the intervals of studious labor with the play of female fancy,
and to secure in this, his culminating age, the solace of female
tendance for his declining years. Hence he determined to abandon
himself to the stream of feeling, and perhaps was surprised to find
what an exceedingly shallow rill it was. As in droughty regions
baptism by immersion could only be performed symbolically, Mr.
Casaubon found that sprinkling was the utmost approach to a plunge
which his stream would afford him; and he concluded that the poets
had much exaggerated the force of masculine passion. Nevertheless,
he observed with pleasure that Miss Brooke showed an ardent
submissive affection which promised to fulfil his most agreeable
previsions of marriage. It had once or twice crossed his mind that
possibly there was some deficiency in Dorothea to account for the
moderation of his abandonment; but he was unable to discern the
deficiency, or to figure to himself a woman who would have pleased
him better; so that there was clearly no reason to fall back upon
but the exaggerations of human tradition.</p>
<p>“Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?” said
Dorothea to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship;
“could I not learn to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as
Milton’s daughters did to their father, without understanding what
they read?”</p>
<p>“I fear that would be wearisome to you,” said Mr. Casaubon,
smiling; “and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you
have mentioned regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a
ground for rebellion against the poet.”</p>
<p>“Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else
they would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the
second place they might have studied privately and taught
themselves to understand what they read, and then it would have
been interesting. I hope you don’t expect me to be naughty and
stupid?”</p>
<p>“I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in
every possible relation of life. Certainly it might be a great
advantage if you were able to copy the Greek character, and to that
end it were well to begin with a little reading.”</p>
<p>Dorothea seized this as a precious permission. She would not
have asked Mr. Casaubon at once to teach her the languages,
dreading of all things to be tiresome instead of helpful; but it
was not entirely out of devotion to her future husband that she
wished to know Latin and Creek. Those provinces of masculine
knowledge seemed to her a standing-ground from which all truth
could be seen more truly. As it was, she constantly doubted her own
conclusions, because she felt her own ignorance: how could she be
confident that one-roomed cottages were not for the glory of God,
when men who knew the classics appeared to conciliate indifference
to the cottages with zeal for the glory? Perhaps even Hebrew might
be necessary—at least the alphabet and a few roots—in order to
arrive at the core of things, and judge soundly on the social
duties of the Christian. And she had not reached that point of
renunciation at which she would have been satisfied with having a
wise husband: she wished, poor child, to be wise herself. Miss
Brooke was certainly very naive with all her alleged cleverness.
Celia, whose mind had never been thought too powerful, saw the
emptiness of other people’s pretensions much more readily. To have
in general but little feeling, seems to be the only security
against feeling too much on any particular occasion.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour
together, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a
lover, to whom a mistress’s elementary ignorance and difficulties
have a touching fitness. Few scholars would have disliked teaching
the alphabet under such circumstances. But Dorothea herself was a
little shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the
answers she got to some timid questions about the value of the
Greek accents gave her a painful suspicion that here indeed there
might be secrets not capable of explanation to a woman’s
reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself
with his usual strength upon it one day that he came into the
library while the reading was going forward.</p>
<p>“Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics,
mathematics, that kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman—too
taxing, you know.”</p>
<p>“Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,” said Mr.
Casaubon, evading the question. “She had the very considerate
thought of saving my eyes.”</p>
<p>“Ah, well, without understanding, you know—that may not be so
bad. But there is a lightness about the feminine mind—a touch and
go—music, the fine arts, that kind of thing—they should study those
up to a certain point, women should; but in a light way, you know.
A woman should be able to sit down and play you or sing you a good
old English tune. That is what I like; though I have heard most
things—been at the opera in Vienna: Gluck, Mozart, everything of
that sort. But I’m a conservative in music—it’s not like ideas, you
know. I stick to the good old tunes.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano, and I am very glad he is
not,” said Dorothea, whose slight regard for domestic music and
feminine fine art must be forgiven her, considering the small
tinkling and smearing in which they chiefly consisted at that dark
period. She smiled and looked up at her betrothed with grateful
eyes. If he had always been asking her to play the “Last Rose of
Summer,” she would have required much resignation. “He says there
is only an old harpsichord at Lowick, and it is covered with
books.”</p>
<p>“Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear. Celia, now, plays very
prettily, and is always ready to play. However, since Casaubon does
not like it, you are all right. But it’s a pity you should not have
little recreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always
strung—that kind of thing, you know—will not do.”</p>
<p>“I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have
my ears teased with measured noises,” said Mr. Casaubon. “A tune
much iterated has the ridiculous effect of making the words in my
mind perform a sort of minuet to keep time—an effect hardly
tolerable, I imagine, after boyhood. As to the grander forms of
music, worthy to accompany solemn celebrations, and even to serve
as an educating influence according to the ancient conception, I
say nothing, for with these we are not immediately concerned.”</p>
<p>“No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,” said Dorothea.
“When we were coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear
the great organ at Freiberg, and it made me sob.”</p>
<p>“That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke.
“Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece
to take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?”</p>
<p>He ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really
thinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married to
so sober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of
Chettam.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful, though,” he said to himself as he shuffled out
of the room—“it is wonderful that she should have liked him.
However, the match is good. I should have been travelling out of my
brief to have hindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will.
He is pretty certain to be a bishop, is Casaubon. That was a very
seasonable pamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:—a deanery at
least. They owe him a deanery.”</p>
<p>And here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical
reflectiveness, by remarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion
little thought of the Radical speech which, at a later period, he
was led to make on the incomes of the bishops. What elegant
historian would neglect a striking opportunity for pointing out
that his heroes did not foresee the history of the world, or even
their own actions?—For example, that Henry of Navarre, when a
Protestant baby, little thought of being a Catholic monarch; or
that Alfred the Great, when he measured his laborious nights with
burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen measuring their
idle days with watches. Here is a mine of truth, which, however
vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our coal.</p>
<p>But of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted
by precedent—namely, that if he had foreknown his speech, it might
not have made any great difference. To think with pleasure of his
niece’s husband having a large ecclesiastical income was one
thing—to make a Liberal speech was another thing; and it is a
narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of
view.</p>
