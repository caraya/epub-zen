<blockquote><p>
          Our deeds still travel with us from afar,
          And what we have been makes us what we are.“
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">B</span>ulstrode's first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was
to examine Raffles's pockets, which he imagined were sure to carry
signs in the shape of hotel-bills of the places he had stopped in,
if he had not told the truth in saying that he had come straight
from Liverpool because he was ill and had no money. There were
various bills crammed into his pocketbook, but none of a later date
than Christmas at any other place, except one, which bore date that
morning. This was crumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair
in one of his tail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days'
stay at an inn at Bilkley, where the fair was held—a town at least
forty miles from Middlemarch. The bill was heavy, and since Raffles
had no luggage with him, it seemed probable that he had left his
portmanteau behind in payment, in order to save money for his
travelling fare; for his purse was empty, and he had only a couple
of sixpences and some loose pence in his pockets.</p>
<p>Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that
Raffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his
memorable visit at Christmas. At a distance and among people who
were strangers to Bulstrode, what satisfaction could there be to
Raffles’s tormenting, self-magnifying vein in telling old
scandalous stories about a Middlemarch banker? And what harm if he
did talk? The chief point now was to keep watch over him as long as
there was any danger of that intelligible raving, that
unaccountable impulse to tell, which seemed to have acted towards
Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much anxiety lest some such impulse
should come over him at the sight of Lydgate. He sat up alone with
him through the night, only ordering the housekeeper to lie down in
her clothes, so as to be ready when he called her, alleging his own
indisposition to sleep, and his anxiety to carry out the doctor’s
orders. He did carry them out faithfully, although Raffles was
incessantly asking for brandy, and declaring that he was sinking
away—that the earth was sinking away from under him. He was
restless and sleepless, but still quailing and manageable. On the
offer of the food ordered by Lydgate, which he refused, and the
denial of other things which he demanded, he seemed to concentrate
all his terror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating his anger, his
revenge on him by starvation, and declaring with strong oaths that
he had never told any mortal a word against him. Even this
Bulstrode felt that he would not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a
more alarming sign of fitful alternation in his delirium was, that
in-the morning twilight Raffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor
present, addressing him and declaring that Bulstrode wanted to
starve him to death out of revenge for telling, when he never had
told.</p>
<p>Bulstrode’s native imperiousness and strength of determination
served him well. This delicate-looking man, himself nervously
perturbed, found the needed stimulus in his strenuous
circumstances, and through that difficult night and morning, while
he had the air of an animated corpse returned to movement without
warmth, holding the mastery by its chill impassibility his mind was
intensely at work thinking of what he had to guard against and what
would win him security. Whatever prayers he might lift up, whatever
statements he might inwardly make of this man’s wretched spiritual
condition, and the duty he himself was under to submit to the
punishment divinely appointed for him rather than to wish for evil
to another—through all this effort to condense words into a solid
mental state, there pierced and spread with irresistible vividness
the images of the events he desired. And in the train of those
images came their apology. He could not but see the death of
Raffles, and see in it his own deliverance. What was the removal of
this wretched creature? He was impenitent—but were not public
criminals impenitent?—yet the law decided on their fate. Should
Providence in this case award death, there was no sin in
contemplating death as the desirable issue—if he kept his hands
from hastening it—if he scrupulously did what was prescribed. Even
here there might be a mistake: human prescriptions were fallible
things: Lydgate had said that treatment had hastened death,—why not
his own method of treatment? But of course intention was everything
in the question of right and wrong.</p>
<p>And Bulstrode set himself to keep his intention separate from
his desire. He inwardly declared that he intended to obey orders.
Why should he have got into any argument about the validity of
these orders? It was only the common trick of desire—which avails
itself of any irrelevant scepticism, finding larger room for itself
in all uncertainty about effects, in every obscurity that looks
like the absence of law. Still, he did obey the orders.</p>
<p>His anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate, and his
remembrance of what had taken place between them the morning before
was accompanied with sensibilities which had not been roused at all
during the actual scene. He had then cared but little about
Lydgate’s painful impressions with regard to the suggested change
in the Hospital, or about the disposition towards himself which
what he held to be his justifiable refusal of a rather exorbitant
request might call forth. He recurred to the scene now with a
perception that he had probably made Lydgate his enemy, and with an
awakened desire to propitiate him, or rather to create in him a
strong sense of personal obligation. He regretted that he had not
at once made even an unreasonable money-sacrifice. For in case of
unpleasant suspicions, or even knowledge gathered from the raving
of Raffles, Bulstrode would have felt that he had a defence in
Lydgate’s mind by having conferred a momentous benefit on him. But
the regret had perhaps come too late.</p>
<p>Strange, piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man, who
had longed for years to be better than he was—who had taken his
selfish passions into discipline and clad them in severe robes, so
that he had walked with them as a devout choir, till now that a
terror had risen among them, and they could chant no longer, but
threw out their common cries for safety.</p>
<p>It was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived: he
had meant to come earlier, but had been detained, he said; and his
shattered looks were noticed by Balstrode. But he immediately threw
himself into the consideration of the patient, and inquired
strictly into all that had occurred. Raffles was worse, would take
hardly any food, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving;
but still not violent. Contrary to Bulstrode’s alarmed expectation,
he took little notice of Lydgate’s presence, and continued to talk
or murmur incoherently.</p>
<p>“What do you think of him?” said Bulstrode, in private.</p>
<p>“The symptoms are worse.”</p>
<p>“You are less hopeful?”</p>
<p>“No; I still think he may come round. Are you going to stay here
yourself?” said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt
question, which made him uneasy, though in reality it was not due
to any suspicious conjecture.</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so,” said Bulstrode, governing himself and
speaking with deliberation. “Mrs. Bulstrode is advised of the
reasons which detain me. Mrs. Abel and her husband are not
experienced enough to be left quite alone, and this kind of
responsibility is scarcely included in their service of me. You
have some fresh instructions, I presume.”</p>
<p>The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the
administration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the
sleeplessness continuing after several hours. He had taken the
precaution of bringing opium in his pocket, and he gave minute
directions to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which
they should cease. He insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and
repeated his order that no alcohol should be given.</p>
<p>“From what I see of the case,” he ended, “narcotism is the only
thing I should be much afraid of. He may wear through even without
much food. There’s a good deal of strength in him.”</p>
<p>“You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate—a most unusual, I may say
unprecedented thing in my knowledge of you,” said Bulstrode,
showing a solicitude as unlike his indifference the day before, as
his present recklessness about his own fatigue was unlike his
habitual self-cherishing anxiety. “I fear you are harassed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am,” said Lydgate, brusquely, holding his hat, and ready
to go.</p>
<p>“Something new, I fear,” said Bulstrode, inquiringly. “Pray be
seated.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you,” said Lydgate, with some hauteur. “I mentioned
to you yesterday what was the state of my affairs. There is nothing
to add, except that the execution has since then been actually put
into my house. One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short
sentence. I will say good morning.”</p>
<p>“Stay, Mr. Lydgate, stay,” said Bulstrode; “I have been
reconsidering this subject. I was yesterday taken by surprise, and
saw it superficially. Mrs. Bulstrode is anxious for her niece, and
I myself should grieve at a calamitous change in your position.
Claims on me are numerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem it
right that I should incur a small sacrifice rather than leave you
unaided. You said, I think, that a thousand pounds would suffice
entirely to free you from your burthens, and enable you to recover
a firm stand?”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting
every other feeling; ”that would pay all my debts, and leave me a
little on hand. I could set about economizing in our way of living.
And by-and-by my practice might look up.“</p>
<p>“If you will wait a moment, Mr. Lydgate, I will draw a cheek to
that amount. I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases,
should be thorough.”</p>
<p>While Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of
his home—thinking of his life with its good start saved from
frustration, its good purposes still unbroken.</p>
<p>“You can give me a note of hand for this, Mr. Lydgate,” said the
banker, advancing towards him with the check. “And by-and-by, I
hope, you may be in circumstances gradually to repay me. Meanwhile,
I have pleasure in thinking that you will be released from further
difficulty.”</p>
<p>“I am deeply obliged to you,” said Lydgate. “You have restored
to me the prospect of working with some happiness and some chance
of good.”</p>
<p>It appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he
should have reconsidered his refusal: it corresponded with the more
munificent side of his character. But as he put his hack into a
canter, that he might get the sooner home, and tell the good news
to Rosamond, and get cash at the bank to pay over to Dover’s agent,
there crossed his mind, with an unpleasant impression, as from a
dark-winged flight of evil augury across his vision, the thought of
that contrast in himself which a few months had brought—that he
should be overjoyed at being under a strong personal
obligation—that he should be overjoyed at getting money for himself
from Bulstrode.</p>
<p>The banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause
of uneasiness, and yet he was scarcely the easier. He did not
measure the quantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for
Lydgate’s good-will, but the quantity was none the less actively
there, like an irritating agent in his blood. A man vows, and yet
will not cast away the means of breaking his vow. Is it that he
distinctly means to break it? Not at all; but the desires which
tend to break it are at work in him dimly, and make their way into
his imagination, and relax his muscles in the very moments when he
is telling himself over again the reasons for his vow. Raffles,
recovering quickly, returning to the free use of his odious
powers—how could Bulstrode wish for that? Raffles dead was the
image that brought release, and indirectly he prayed for that way
of release, beseeching that, if it were possible, the rest of his
days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which
would break him utterly as an instrument of God’s service.
Lydgate’s opinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer
would be fulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt himself
getting irritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he would
fain have seen sinking into the silence of death imperious will
stirred murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which
will, by itself, had no power. He said inwardly that he was getting
too much worn; he would not sit up with the patient to-night, but
leave him to Mrs. Abel, who, if necessary, could call her
husband.</p>
<p>At six o’clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed
snatches of sleep, from which he waked with fresh restlessness and
perpetual cries that he was sinking away, Bulstrode began to
administer the opium according to Lydgate’s directions. At the end
of half an hour or more he called Mrs. Abel and told her that he
found himself unfit for further watching. He must now consign the
patient to her care; and he proceeded to repeat to her Lydgate’s
directions as to the quantity of each dose. Mrs. Abel had not
before known anything of Lydgate’s prescriptions; she had simply
prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode ordered, and had done what
he pointed out to her. She began now to ask what else she should do
besides administering the opium.</p>
<p>“Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the
soda-water: you can come to me for further directions. Unless there
is any important change, I shall not come into the room again
to-night. You will ask your husband for help if necessary. I must
go to bed early.”</p>
<p>“You’ve much need, sir, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Abel, “and to take
something more strengthening than what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might
say in his raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not
likely to create any dangerous belief. At any rate he must risk
this. He went down into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to
consider whether he would not have his horse saddled and go home by
the moonlight, and give up caring for earthly consequences. Then,
he wished that he had begged Lydgate to come again that evening.
Perhaps he might deliver a different opinion, and think that
Raffles was getting into a less hopeful state. Should he send for
Lydgate? If Raffles were really getting worse, and slowly dying,
Bulstrode felt that he could go to bed and sleep in gratitude to
Providence. But was he worse? Lydgate might come and simply say
that he was going on as he expected, and predict that he would
by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was the use of
sending for him? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No ideas or
opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be,
that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with
his strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to drag away his
wife to spend her years apart from her friends and native place,
carrying an alienating suspicion against him in her heart.</p>
<p>He had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight
only, when a sudden thought made him rise and light the bed-candle,
which he had brought down with him. The thought was, that he had
not told Mrs. Abel when the doses of opium must cease.</p>
<p>He took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long
while. She might already have given him more than Lydgate had
prescribed. But it was excusable in him, that he should forget part
of an order, in his present wearied condition. He walked up-stairs,
candle in hand, not knowing whether he should straightway enter his
own room and go to bed, or turn to the patient’s room and rectify
his omission. He paused in the passage, with his face turned
towards Raffles’s room, and he could hear him moaning and
murmuring. He was not asleep, then. Who could know that Lydgate’s
prescription would not be better disobeyed than followed, since
there was still no sleep?</p>
<p>He turned into his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs.
Abel rapped at the door; he opened it an inch, so that he could
hear her speak low.</p>
<p>“If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give
the poor creetur? He feels sinking away, and nothing else will he
swaller—and but little strength in it, if he did—only the opium.
And he says more and more he’s sinking down through the earth.”</p>
<p>To her surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was
going on within him.</p>
<p>“I think he must die for want o’ support, if he goes on in that
way. When I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him
port-wine and brandy constant, and a big glass at a time,” added
Mrs. Abel, with a touch of remonstrance in her tone.</p>
<p>But again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and she
continued, “It’s not a time to spare when people are at death’s
door, nor would you wish it, sir, I’m sure. Else I should give him
our own bottle o’ rum as we keep by us. But a sitter-up so as
you’ve been, and doing everything as laid in your power—”</p>
<p>Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr.
Bulstrode said huskily, “That is the key of the wine-cooler. You
will find plenty of brandy there.”</p>
<p>Early in the morning—about six—Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some
time in prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is
necessarily candid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private
prayer is inaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can
represent himself just as he is, even in his own reflections?
Bulstrode had not yet unravelled in his thought the confused
promptings of the last four-and-twenty hours.</p>
<p>He listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous
breathing. Then he walked out in the garden, and looked at the
early rime on the grass and fresh spring leaves. When he re-entered
the house, he felt startled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.</p>
<p>“How is your patient—asleep, I think?” he said, with an attempt
at cheerfulness in his tone.</p>
<p>“He’s gone very deep, sir,” said Mrs. Abel. “He went off gradual
between three and four o’clock. Would you please to go and look at
him? I thought it no harm to leave him. My man’s gone afield, and
the little girl’s seeing to the kettles.”</p>
<p>Bulstrode went up. At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in
the sleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams
deeper and deeper into the gulf of death.</p>
<p>He looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in
it, and the almost empty opium phial. He put the phial out of
sight, and carried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with him, locking
it again in the wine-cooler.</p>
<p>While breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to
Middlemarch at once, or wait for Lydgate’s arrival. He decided to
wait, and told Mrs. Abel that she might go about her work—he could
watch in the bed-chamber.</p>
<p>As he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going
irrevocably into silence, he felt more at rest than he had done for
many months. His conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of
secrecy, which seemed just then like an angel sent down for his
relief. He drew out his pocket-book to review various memoranda
there as to the arrangements he had projected and partly carried
out in the prospect of quitting Middlemarch, and considered how far
he would let them stand or recall them, now that his absence would
be brief. Some economies which he felt desirable might still find a
suitable occasion in his temporary withdrawal from management, and
he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would take a large share in the
expenses of the Hospital. In that way the moments passed, until a
change in the stertorous breathing was marked enough to draw his
attention wholly to the bed, and forced him to think of the
departing life, which had once been subservient to his own—which he
had once been glad to find base enough for him to act on as he
would. It was his gladness then which impelled him now to be glad
that the life was at an end.</p>
<p>And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened?
Who knew what would have saved him?</p>
<p>Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final
pause of the breath. When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a
sudden expression in his face, which was not so much surprise as a
recognition that he had not judged correctly. He stood by the bed
in silence for some time, with his eyes turned on the dying man,
but with that subdued activity of expression which showed that he
was carrying on an inward debate.</p>
<p>“When did this change begin?” said he, looking at Bulstrode.</p>
<p>“I did not watch by him last night,” said Bulstrode. “I was
over-worn, and left him under Mrs. Abel’s care. She said that he
sank into sleep between three and four o’clock. When I came in
before eight he was nearly in this condition.”</p>
<p>Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence
until he said, “It’s all over.”</p>
<p>This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and
freedom. He had set out on his work with all his old animation, and
felt himself strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his
married life. And he was conscious that Bulstrode had been a
benefactor to him. But he was uneasy about this case. He had not
expected it to terminate as it had done. Yet he hardly knew how to
put a question on the subject to Bulstrode without appearing to
insult him; and if he examined the housekeeper—why, the man was
dead. There seemed to be no use in implying that somebody’s
ignorance or imprudence had killed him. And after all, he himself
might be wrong.</p>
<p>He and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of
many things—chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in
the House of Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions.
Nothing was said about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the
necessity of having a grave for him in Lowick churchyard, and
observed that, so far as he knew, the poor man had no connections,
except Rigg, whom he had stated to be unfriendly towards him.</p>
<p>On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The
Vicar had not been in the town the day before, but the news that
there was an execution in Lydgate’s house had got to Lowick by the
evening, having been carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and
parish-clerk, who had it from his brother, the respectable
bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that evening when Lydgate had
come down from the billiard room with Fred Vincy, Mr. Farebrother’s
thoughts about him had been rather gloomy. Playing at the Green
Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in another man; but
in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he was getting unlike
his former self. He was beginning to do things for which he had
formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain dissatisfactions
in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had given him
hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother felt
sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being
more and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any
notion of Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background
must be quite illusory. The rebuff he had met with in his first
attempt to win Lydgate’s confidence, disinclined him to a second;
but this news of the execution being actually in the house,
determined the Vicar to overcome his reluctance.</p>
<p>Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much
interested, and he came forward to put out his hand—with an open
cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a
proud rejection of sympathy and help? Never mind; the sympathy and
help should be offered.</p>
<p>“How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard
something which made me anxious about you,” said the Vicar, in the
tone of a good brother, only that there was no reproach in it. They
were both seated by this time, and Lydgate answered
immediately—</p>
<p>“I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an
execution in the house?”</p>
<p>“Yes; is it true?”</p>
<p>“It was true,” said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if he
did not mind talking about the affair now. “But the danger is over;
the debt is paid. I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed
from debts, and able, I hope, to start afresh on a better
plan.”</p>
<p>“I am very thankful to hear it,” said the Vicar, falling back in
his chair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often
follows the removal of a load. “I like that better than all the
news in the ’Times.’ I confess I came to you with a heavy
heart.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming,” said Lydgate, cordially. “I can enjoy
the kindness all the more because I am happier. I have certainly
been a good deal crushed. I’m afraid I shall find the bruises still
painful by-and by,” he added, smiling rather sadly; “but just now I
can only feel that the torture-screw is off.”</p>
<p>Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said
earnestly, “My dear fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me
if I take a liberty.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you will ask anything that ought to offend
me.”</p>
<p>“Then—this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest—you have
not—have you?—in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt
which may harass you worse hereafter?”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Lydgate, coloring slightly. ”There is no reason why I
should not tell you—since the fact is so—that the person to whom I
am indebted is Bulstrode. He has made me a very handsome advance—a
thousand pounds—and he can afford to wait for repayment.“</p>
<p>“Well, that is generous,” said Mr. Farebrother, compelling
himself to approve of the man whom he disliked. His delicate
feeling shrank from dwelling even in his thought on the fact that
he had always urged Lydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with
Bulstrode. He added immediately, “And Bulstrode must naturally feel
an interest in your welfare, after you have worked with him in a
way which has probably reduced your income instead of adding to it.
I am glad to think that he has acted accordingly.”</p>
<p>Lydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions. They
made more distinct within him the uneasy consciousness which had
shown its first dim stirrings only a few hours before, that
Bulstrode’s motives for his sudden beneficence following close upon
the chillest indifference might be merely selfish. He let the
kindly suppositions pass. He could not tell the history of the
loan, but it was more vividly present with him than ever, as well
as the fact which the Vicar delicately ignored—that this relation
of personal indebtedness to Bulstrode was what he had once been
most resolved to avoid.</p>
<p>He began, instead of answering, to speak of his projected
economies, and of his having come to look at his life from a
different point of view.</p>
<p>“I shall set up a surgery,” he said. “I really think I made a
mistaken effort in that respect. And if Rosamond will not mind, I
shall take an apprentice. I don’t like these things, but if one
carries them out faithfully they are not really lowering. I have
had a severe galling to begin with: that will make the small rubs
seem easy.”</p>
<p>Poor Lydgate! the “if Rosamond will not mind,” which had fallen
from him involuntarily as part of his thought, was a significant
mark of the yoke he bore. But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered
strongly into the same current with Lydgate’s, and who knew nothing
about him that could now raise a melancholy presentiment, left him
with affectionate congratulation.</p>
