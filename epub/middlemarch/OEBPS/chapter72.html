<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">D</span>orothea's impetuous generosity, which would have leaped at once
to the vindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted
money as a bribe, underwent a melancholy check when she came to
consider all the circumstances of the case by the light of Mr.
Farebrother's experience.</p>
<p>“It is a delicate matter to touch,” he said. “How can we begin
to inquire into it? It must be either publicly by setting the
magistrate and coroner to work, or privately by questioning
Lydgate. As to the first proceeding there is no solid ground to go
upon, else Hawley would have adopted it; and as to opening the
subject with Lydgate, I confess I should shrink from it. He would
probably take it as a deadly insult. I have more than once
experienced the difficulty of speaking to him on personal matters.
And—one should know the truth about his conduct beforehand, to feel
very confident of a good result.”</p>
<p>“I feel convinced that his conduct has not been guilty: I
believe that people are almost always better than their neighbors
think they are,” said Dorothea. Some of her intensest experience in
the last two years had set her mind strongly in opposition to any
unfavorable construction of others; and for the first time she felt
rather discontented with Mr. Farebrother. She disliked this
cautious weighing of consequences, instead of an ardent faith in
efforts of justice and mercy, which would conquer by their
emotional force. Two days afterwards, he was dining at the Manor
with her uncle and the Chettams, and when the dessert was standing
uneaten, the servants were out of the room, and Mr. Brooke was
nodding in a nap, she returned to the subject with renewed
vivacity.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lydgate would understand that if his friends hear a calumny
about him their first wish must be to justify him. What do we live
for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other? I
cannot be indifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in
<i>my</i> trouble, and attended me in my illness."</p>
<p>Dorothea’s tone and manner were not more energetic than they had
been when she was at the head of her uncle’s table nearly three
years before, and her experience since had given her more right to
express a decided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the
diffident and acquiescent suitor: he was the anxious
brother-in-law, with a devout admiration for his sister, but with a
constant alarm lest she should fall under some new illusion almost
as bad as marrying Casaubon. He smiled much less; when he said
“Exactly“ it was more often an introduction to a dissentient
opinion than in those submissive bachelor days; and Dorothea found
to her surprise that she had to resolve not to be afraid of him—all
the more because he was really her best friend. He disagreed with
her now.</p>
<p>“But, Dorothea,” he said, remonstrantly, “you can’t undertake to
manage a man’s life for him in that way. Lydgate must know—at least
he will soon come to know how he stands. If he can clear himself,
he will. He must act for himself.”</p>
<p>“I think his friends must wait till they find an opportunity,”
added Mr. Farebrother. “It is possible—I have often felt so much
weakness in myself that I can conceive even a man of honorable
disposition, such as I have always believed Lydgate to be,
succumbing to such a temptation as that of accepting money which
was offered more or less indirectly as a bribe to insure his
silence about scandalous facts long gone by. I say, I can conceive
this, if he were under the pressure of hard circumstances—if he had
been harassed as I feel sure Lydgate has been. I would not believe
anything worse of him except under stringent proof. But there is
the terrible Nemesis following on some errors, that it is always
possible for those who like it to interpret them into a crime:
there is no proof in favor of the man outside his own consciousness
and assertion.”</p>
<p>“Oh, how cruel!” said Dorothea, clasping her hands. “And would
you not like to be the one person who believed in that man’s
innocence, if the rest of the world belied him? Besides, there is a
man’s character beforehand to speak for him.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling
gently at her ardor, “character is not cut in marble—it is not
something solid and unalterable. It is something living and
changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do.”</p>
<p>“Then it may be rescued and healed,” said Dorothea “I should not
be afraid of asking Mr. Lydgate to tell me the truth, that I might
help him. Why should I be afraid? Now that I am not to have the
land, James, I might do as Mr. Bulstrode proposed, and take his
place in providing for the Hospital; and I have to consult Mr.
Lydgate, to know thoroughly what are the prospects of doing good by
keeping up the present plans. There is the best opportunity in the
world for me to ask for his confidence; and he would be able to
tell me things which might make all the circumstances clear. Then
we would all stand by him and bring him out of his trouble. People
glorify all sorts of bravery except the bravery they might show on
behalf of their nearest neighbors.” Dorothea’s eyes had a moist
brightness in them, and the changed tones of her voice roused her
uncle, who began to listen.</p>
<p>“It is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy
which would hardly succeed if we men undertook them,” said Mr.
Farebrother, almost converted by Dorothea’s ardor.</p>
<p>“Surely, a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who
know the world better than she does.” said Sir James, with his
little frown. “Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should
really keep back at present, and not volunteer any meddling with
this Bulstrode business. We don’t know yet what may turn up. You
must agree with me?” he ended, looking at Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p>“I do think it would be better to wait,” said the latter.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, not quite knowing at what
point the discussion had arrived, but coming up to it with a
contribution which was generally appropriate. “It is easy to go too
far, you know. You must not let your ideas run away with you. And
as to being in a hurry to put money into schemes—it won’t do, you
know. Garth has drawn me in uncommonly with repairs, draining, that
sort of thing: I’m uncommonly out of pocket with one thing or
another. I must pull up. As for you, Chettam, you are spending a
fortune on those oak fences round your demesne.”</p>
<p>Dorothea, submitting uneasily to this discouragement, went with
Celia into the library, which was her usual drawing-room.</p>
<p>“Now, Dodo, do listen to what James says,” said Celia, “else you
will be getting into a scrape. You always did, and you always will,
when you set about doing as you please. And I think it is a mercy
now after all that you have got James to think for you. He lets you
have your plans, only he hinders you from being taken in. And that
is the good of having a brother instead of a husband. A husband
would not let you have your plans.”</p>
<p>“As if I wanted a husband!” said Dorothea. “I only want not to
have my feelings checked at every turn.” Mrs. Casaubon was still
undisciplined enough to burst into angry tears.</p>
<p>“Now, really, Dodo,” said Celia, with rather a deeper guttural
than usual, “you <i>are</i> contradictory: first one thing and then
another. You used to submit to Mr. Casaubon quite shamefully: I
think you would have given up ever coming to see me if he had asked
you."</p>
<p>“Of course I submitted to him, because it was my duty; it was my
feeling for him,” said Dorothea, looking through the prism of her
tears.</p>
<p>“Then why can’t you think it your duty to submit a little to
what James wishes?” said Celia, with a sense of stringency in her
argument. “Because he only wishes what is for your own good. And,
of course, men know best about everything, except what women know
better.” Dorothea laughed and forgot her tears.</p>
<p>“Well, I mean about babies and those things,” explained Celia.
“I should not give up to James when I knew he was wrong, as you
used to do to Mr. Casaubon.”</p>
