<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of
Windsor, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, and Mr.
Vincy was mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch, Mrs.
Casaubon, born Dorothea Brooke, had taken her wedding journey to
Rome. In those days the world in general was more ignorant of good
and evil by forty years than it is at present. Travellers did not
often carry full information on Christian art either in their heads
or their pockets; and even the most brilliant English critic of the
day mistook the flower-flushed tomb of the ascended Virgin for an
ornamental vase due to the painter's fancy. Romanticism, which has
helped to fill some dull blanks with love and knowledge, had not
yet penetrated the times with its leaven and entered into
everybody's food; it was fermenting still as a distinguishable
vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German artists at Rome,
and the youth of other nations who worked or idled near them were
sometimes caught in the spreading movement.</p>
<p>One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately
long, but abundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his
equipment, had just turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the
Vatican and was looking out on the magnificent view of the
mountains from the adjoining round vestibule. He was sufficiently
absorbed not to notice the approach of a dark-eyed, animated German
who came up to him and placing a hand on his shoulder, said with a
strong accent, “Come here, quick! else she will have changed her
pose.”</p>
<p>Quickness was ready at the call, and the two figures passed
lightly along by the Meleager, towards the hall where the reclining
Ariadne, then called the Cleopatra, lies in the marble
voluptuousness of her beauty, the drapery folding around her with a
petal-like ease and tenderness. They were just in time to see
another figure standing against a pedestal near the reclining
marble: a breathing blooming girl, whose form, not shamed by the
Ariadne, was clad in Quakerish gray drapery; her long cloak,
fastened at the neck, was thrown backward from her arms, and one
beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek, pushing somewhat
backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to her
face around the simply braided dark-brown hair. She was not looking
at the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her large eyes were
fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor.
But she became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly paused
as if to contemplate the Cleopatra, and, without looking at them,
immediately turned away to join a maid-servant and courier who were
loitering along the hall at a little distance off.</p>
<p>“What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis?” said
the German, searching in his friend’s face for responding
admiration, but going on volubly without waiting for any other
answer. “There lies antique beauty, not corpse-like even in death,
but arrested in the complete contentment of its sensuous
perfection: and here stands beauty in its breathing life, with the
consciousness of Christian centuries in its bosom. But she should
be dressed as a nun; I think she looks almost what you call a
Quaker; I would dress her as a nun in my picture. However, she is
married; I saw her wedding-ring on that wonderful left hand,
otherwise I should have thought the sallow Geistlicher was her
father. I saw him parting from her a good while ago, and just now I
found her in that magnificent pose. Only think! he is perhaps rich,
and would like to have her portrait taken. Ah! it is no use looking
after her—there she goes! Let us follow her home!”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said his companion, with a little frown.</p>
<p>“You are singular, Ladislaw. You look struck together. Do you
know her?”</p>
<p>“I know that she is married to my cousin,” said Will Ladislaw,
sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German
friend kept at his side and watched him eagerly.</p>
<p>“What! the Geistlicher? He looks more like an uncle—a more
useful sort of relation.”</p>
<p>“He is not my uncle. I tell you he is my second cousin,” said
Ladislaw, with some irritation.</p>
<p>“Schon, schon. Don’t be snappish. You are not angry with me for
thinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever
saw?”</p>
<p>“Angry? nonsense. I have only seen her once before, for a couple
of minutes, when my cousin introduced her to me, just before I left
England. They were not married then. I didn’t know they were coming
to Rome.”</p>
<p>“But you will go to see them now—you will find out what they
have for an address—since you know the name. Shall we go to the
post? And you could speak about the portrait.”</p>
<p>“Confound you, Naumann! I don’t know what I shall do. I am not
so brazen as you.”</p>
<p>“Bah! that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish. If
you were an artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as
antique form animated by Christian sentiment—a sort of Christian
Antigone—sensuous force controlled by spiritual passion.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her
existence—the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but
exhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas. I am
amateurish if you like: I do <i>not</i> think that all the universe
is straining towards the obscure significance of your
pictures."</p>
<p>“But it is, my dear!—so far as it is straining through me, Adolf
Naumann: that stands firm,” said the good-natured painter, putting
a hand on Ladislaw’s shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by
the unaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone. “See now! My
existence presupposes the existence of the whole universe—does it
<i>not?</i> and my function is to paint—and as a painter I have a
conception which is altogether genialisch, of your great-aunt or
second grandmother as a subject for a picture; therefore, the
universe is straining towards that picture through that particular
hook or claw which it puts forth in the shape of me—not true?"</p>
<p>“But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to
thwart it?—the case is a little less simple then.”</p>
<p>“Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same
thing—picture or no picture—logically.”</p>
<p>Will could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud
in his face broke into sunshiny laughter.</p>
<p>“Come now, my friend—you will help?” said Naumann, in a hopeful
tone.</p>
<p>“No; nonsense, Naumann! English ladies are not at everybody’s
service as models. And you want to express too much with your
painting. You would only have made a better or worse portrait with
a background which every connoisseur would give a different reason
for or against. And what is a portrait of a woman? Your painting
and Plastik are poor stuff after all. They perturb and dull
conceptions instead of raising them. Language is a finer
medium.”</p>
<p>“Yes, for those who can’t paint,” said Naumann. “There you have
perfect right. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.”</p>
<p>The amiable artist carried his sting, but Ladislaw did not
choose to appear stung. He went on as if he had not heard.</p>
<p>“Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for
beings vague. After all, the true seeing is within; and painting
stares at you with an insistent imperfection. I feel that
especially about representations of women. As if a woman were a
mere colored superficies! You must wait for movement and tone.
There is a difference in their very breathing: they change from
moment to moment.—This woman whom you have just seen, for example:
how would you paint her voice, pray? But her voice is much diviner
than anything you have seen of her.”</p>
<p>“I see, I see. You are jealous. No man must presume to think
that he can paint your ideal. This is serious, my friend! Your
great-aunt! ’Der Neffe als Onkel’ in a tragic sense—ungeheuer!”</p>
<p>“You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt
again.”</p>
<p>“How is she to be called then?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Casaubon.”</p>
<p>“Good. Suppose I get acquainted with her in spite of you, and
find that she very much wishes to be painted?”</p>
<p>“Yes, suppose!” said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,
intended to dismiss the subject. He was conscious of being
irritated by ridiculously small causes, which were half of his own
creation. Why was he making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon? And yet
he felt as if something had happened to him with regard to her.
There are characters which are continually creating collisions and
nodes for themselves in dramas which nobody is prepared to act with
them. Their susceptibilities will clash against objects that remain
innocently quiet.</p>
