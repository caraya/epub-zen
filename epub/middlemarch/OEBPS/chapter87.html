<p>Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit
young lives after being long in company with them, and not desire
to know what befell them in their after-years? For the fragment of
a life, however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises
may not be kept, and an ardent outset may be followed by
declension; latent powers may find their long-waited opportunity; a
past error may urge a grand retrieval.</p>
<p>Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is
still a great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their
honeymoon in Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns
and thistles of the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the
home epic—the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that
complete union which makes the advancing years a climax, and age
the harvest of sweet memories in common.</p>
<p>Some set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment
of hope and enthusiasm and get broken by the way, wanting patience
with each other and the world.</p>
<p>All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to
know that these two made no such failure, but achieved a solid
mutual happiness. Fred surprised his neighbors in various ways. He
became rather distinguished in his side of the county as a
theoretic and practical farmer, and produced a work on the
“Cultivation of Green Crops and the Economy of Cattle-Feeding”
which won him high congratulations at agricultural meetings. In
Middlemarch admiration was more reserved: most persons there were
inclined to believe that the merit of Fred’s authorship was due to
his wife, since they had never expected Fred Vincy to write on
turnips and mangel-wurzel.</p>
<p>But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called “Stories
of Great Men, taken from Plutarch,” and had it printed and
published by Gripp &amp; Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town
was willing to give the credit of this work to Fred, observing that
he had been to the University, “where the ancients were studied,”
and might have been a clergyman if he had chosen.</p>
<p>In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been
deceived, and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing
a book, since it was always done by somebody else.</p>
<p>Moreover, Fred remained unswervingly steady. Some years after
his marriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to
Farebrother, who gave him a strong pull-up at the right moment. I
cannot say that he was never again misled by his hopefulness: the
yield of crops or the profits of a cattle sale usually fell below
his estimate; and he was always prone to believe that he could make
money by the purchase of a horse which turned out badly—though
this, Mary observed, was of course the fault of the horse, not of
Fred’s judgment. He kept his love of horsemanship, but he rarely
allowed himself a day’s hunting; and when he did so, it was
remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for cowardliness at
the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on the
five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between hedge and
ditch.</p>
<p>There were three boys: Mary was not discontented that she
brought forth men-children only; and when Fred wished to have a
girl like her, she said, laughingly, “that would be too great a
trial to your mother.” Mrs. Vincy in her declining years, and in
the diminished lustre of her housekeeping, was much comforted by
her perception that two at least of Fred’s boys were real Vincys,
and did not “feature the Garths.” But Mary secretly rejoiced that
the youngest of the three was very much what her father must have
been when he wore a round jacket, and showed a marvellous nicety of
aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones to bring down the
mellow pears.</p>
<p>Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were
well in their teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces
were more desirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were
good for less than boys, else they would not be always in
petticoats, which showed how little they were meant for; whereupon
Letty, who argued much from books, got angry in replying that God
made coats of skins for both Adam and Eve alike—also it occurred to
her that in the East the men too wore petticoats. But this latter
argument, obscuring the majesty of the former, was one too many,
for Ben answered contemptuously, “The more spooneys they!” and
immediately appealed to his mother whether boys were not better
than girls. Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were alike naughty, but
that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, and throw
with more precision to a greater distance. With this oracular
sentence Ben was well satisfied, not minding the naughtiness; but
Letty took it ill, her feeling of superiority being stronger than
her muscles.</p>
<p>Fred never became rich—his hopefulness had not led him to expect
that; but he gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock
and furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into
his hands carried him in plenty through those “bad times” which are
always present with farmers. Mary, in her matronly days, became as
solid in figure as her mother; but, unlike her, gave the boys
little formal teaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they
should never be well grounded in grammar and geography.
Nevertheless, they were found quite forward enough when they went
to school; perhaps, because they had liked nothing so well as being
with their mother. When Fred was riding home on winter evenings he
had a pleasant vision beforehand of the bright hearth in the
wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who could not have
Mary for their wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother. “He was ten
times worthier of you than I was,” Fred could now say to her,
magnanimously. “To be sure he was,” Mary answered; “and for that
reason he could do better without me. But you—I shudder to think
what you would have been—a curate in debt for horse-hire and
cambric pocket-handkerchiefs!”</p>
<p>On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still
inhabit Stone Court—that the creeping plants still cast the foam of
their blossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the
walnut-trees stand in stately row—and that on sunny days the two
lovers who were first engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in
white-haired placidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in
the days of old Peter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look
out for Mr. Lydgate.</p>
<p>Lydgate’s hair never became white. He died when he was only
fifty, leaving his wife and children provided for by a heavy
insurance on his life. He had gained an excellent practice,
alternating, according to the season, between London and a
Continental bathing-place; having written a treatise on Gout, a
disease which has a good deal of wealth on its side. His skill was
relied on by many paying patients, but he always regarded himself
as a failure: he had not done what he once meant to do. His
acquaintances thought him enviable to have so charming a wife, and
nothing happened to shake their opinion. Rosamond never committed a
second compromising indiscretion. She simply continued to be mild
in her temper, inflexible in her judgment, disposed to admonish her
husband, and able to frustrate him by stratagem. As the years went
on he opposed her less and less, whence Rosamond concluded that he
had learned the value of her opinion; on the other hand, she had a
more thorough conviction of his talents now that he gained a good
income, and instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided
one all flowers and gilding, fit for the bird of paradise that she
resembled. In brief, Lydgate was what is called a successful man.
But he died prematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards
married an elderly and wealthy physician, who took kindly to her
four children. She made a very pretty show with her daughters,
driving out in her carriage, and often spoke of her happiness as “a
reward“—she did not say for what, but probably she meant that it
was a reward for her patience with Tertius, whose temper never
became faultless, and to the last occasionally let slip a bitter
speech which was more memorable than the signs he made of his
repentance. He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked
for an explanation, said that basil was a plant which had
flourished wonderfully on a murdered man’s brains. Rosamond had a
placid but strong answer to such speeches. Why then had he chosen
her? It was a pity he had not had Mrs. Ladislaw, whom he was always
praising and placing above her. And thus the conversation ended
with the advantage on Rosamond’s side. But it would be unjust not
to tell, that she never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea,
keeping in religious remembrance the generosity which had come to
her aid in the sharpest crisis of her life.</p>
<p>Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other
women, feeling that there was always something better which she
might have done, if she had only been better and known better.
Still, she never repented that she had given up position and
fortune to marry Will Ladislaw, and he would have held it the
greatest shame as well as sorrow to him if she had repented. They
were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which
could have marred it. No life would have been possible to Dorothea
which was not filled with emotion, and she had now a life filled
also with a beneficent activity which she had not the doubtful
pains of discovering and marking out for herself. Will became an
ardent public man, working well in those times when reforms were
begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has been
much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to
Parliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could
have liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her
husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that
she should give him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a
pity that so substantive and rare a creature should have been
absorbed into the life of another, and be only known in a certain
circle as a wife and mother. But no one stated exactly what else
that was in her power she ought rather to have done—not even Sir
James Chettam, who went no further than the negative prescription
that she ought not to have married Will Ladislaw.</p>
<p>But this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation; and
the way in which the family was made whole again was characteristic
of all concerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of
corresponding with Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his pen
had been remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it
ran off into an invitation to the Grange, which, once written,
could not be done away with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly
to be conceived) of the whole valuable letter. During the months of
this correspondence Mr. Brooke had continually, in his talk with
Sir James Chettam, been presupposing or hinting that the intention
of cutting off the entail was still maintained; and the day on
which his pen gave the daring invitation, he went to Freshitt
expressly to intimate that he had a stronger sense than ever of the
reasons for taking that energetic step as a precaution against any
mixture of low blood in the heir of the Brookes.</p>
<p>But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A
letter had come to Celia which made her cry silently as she read
it; and when Sir James, unused to see her in tears, asked anxiously
what was the matter, she burst out in a wail such as he had never
heard from her before.</p>
<p>“Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see
her. And I am sure she wants to see me. And she will not know what
to do with the baby—she will do wrong things with it. And they
thought she would die. It is very dreadful! Suppose it had been me
and little Arthur, and Dodo had been hindered from coming to see
me! I wish you would be less unkind, James!”</p>
<p>“Good heavens, Celia!” said Sir James, much wrought upon, “what
do you wish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town
to-morrow if you wish it.” And Celia did wish it.</p>
<p>It was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet
in the grounds, began to chat with him in ignorance of the news,
which Sir James for some reason did not care to tell him
immediately. But when the entail was touched on in the usual way,
he said, “My dear sir, it is not for me to dictate to you, but for
my part I would let that alone. I would let things remain as they
are.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke felt so much surprised that he did not at once find
out how much he was relieved by the sense that he was not expected
to do anything in particular.</p>
<p>Such being the bent of Celia’s heart, it was inevitable that Sir
James should consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her
husband. Where women love each other, men learn to smother their
mutual dislike. Sir James never liked Ladislaw, and Will always
preferred to have Sir James’s company mixed with another kind: they
were on a footing of reciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy
only when Dorothea and Celia were present.</p>
<p>It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should
pay at least two visits during the year to the Grange, and there
came gradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed
playing with the two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the
blood of these cousins had been less dubiously mixed.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke lived to a good old age, and his estate was inherited
by Dorothea’s son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but
declined, thinking that his opinions had less chance of being
stifled if he remained out of doors.</p>
<p>Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea’s second marriage as a
mistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in
Middlemarch, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a
fine girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her
father, and in little more than a year after his death gave up her
estate to marry his cousin—young enough to have been his son, with
no property, and not well-born. Those who had not seen anything of
Dorothea usually observed that she could not have been “a nice
woman,” else she would not have married either the one or the
other.</p>
<p>Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally
beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse
struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in
which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great
faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward
being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies
outside it. A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of
reforming a conventual life, any more than a new Antigone will
spend her heroic piety in daring all for the sake of a brother’s
burial: the medium in which their ardent deeds took shape is
forever gone. But we insignificant people with our daily words and
acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas, some of which may
present a far sadder sacrifice than that of the Dorothea whose
story we know.</p>
<p>Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they
were not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which
Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no
great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those
around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the
world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are
not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing
to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in
unvisited tombs.</p>
