<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next
morning, lay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all
meadows and pastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy
beauty and to spread out coral fruit for the birds. Little details
gave each field a particular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that
have looked on them from childhood: the pool in the corner where
the grasses were dank and trees leaned whisperingly; the great oak
shadowing a bare place in mid-pasture; the high bank where the
ash-trees grew; the sudden slope of the old marl-pit making a red
background for the burdock; the huddled roofs and ricks of the
homestead without a traceable way of approach; the gray gate and
fences against the depths of the bordering wood; and the stray
hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and valleys with
wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel far to
see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful. These
are the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to
midland-bred souls—the things they toddled among, or perhaps
learned by heart standing between their father's knees while he
drove leisurely.</p>
<p>But the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we
have seen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it
was into Lowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a
couple of miles’ riding. Another mile would bring them to Stone
Court, and at the end of the first half, the house was already
visible, looking as if it had been arrested in its growth toward a
stone mansion by an unexpected budding of farm-buildings on its
left flank, which had hindered it from becoming anything more than
the substantial dwelling of a gentleman farmer. It was not the less
agreeable an object in the distance for the cluster of pinnacled
corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of walnuts on the right.</p>
<p>Presently it was possible to discern something that might be a
gig on the circular drive before the front door.</p>
<p>“Dear me,” said Rosamond, “I hope none of my uncle’s horrible
relations are there.”</p>
<p>“They are, though. That is Mrs. Waule’s gig—the last yellow gig
left, I should think. When I see Mrs. Waule in it, I understand how
yellow can have been worn for mourning. That gig seems to me more
funereal than a hearse. But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape
on. How does she manage it, Rosy? Her friends can’t always be
dying.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know at all. And she is not in the least evangelical,”
said Rosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view
would have fully accounted for perpetual crape. “And, not poor,”
she added, after a moment’s pause.</p>
<p>“No, by George! They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and
Featherstones; I mean, for people like them, who don’t want to
spend anything. And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures, and
are afraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family.
But I believe he hates them all.”</p>
<p>The Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes
of these distant connections, had happened to say this very morning
(not at all with a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral
tone, as of a voice heard through cotton wool) that she did not
wish “to enjoy their good opinion.” She was seated, as she
observed, on her own brother’s hearth, and had been Jane
Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she had been Jane Waule,
which entitled her to speak when her own brother’s name had been
made free with by those who had no right to it.</p>
<p>“What are you driving at there?” said Mr. Featherstone, holding
his stick between his knees and settling his wig, while he gave her
a momentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on him like a
draught of cold air and set him coughing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Waule had to defer her answer till he was quiet again, till
Mary Garth had supplied him with fresh syrup, and he had begun to
rub the gold knob of his stick, looking bitterly at the fire. It
was a bright fire, but it made no difference to the chill-looking
purplish tint of Mrs. Waule’s face, which was as neutral as her
voice; having mere chinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in
speaking.</p>
<p>“The doctors can’t master that cough, brother. It’s just like
what I have; for I’m your own sister, constitution and everything.
But, as I was saying, it’s a pity Mrs. Vincy’s family can’t be
better conducted.”</p>
<p>“Tchah! you said nothing o’ the sort. You said somebody had made
free with my name.”</p>
<p>“And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true.
My brother Solomon tells me it’s the talk up and down in
Middlemarch how unsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever
gambling at billiards since home he came.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! What’s a game at billiards? It’s a good gentlemanly
game; and young Vincy is not a clodhopper. If your son John took to
billiards, now, he’d make a fool of himself.”</p>
<p>“Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game,
brother, and is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what
everybody says is true, must be found somewhere else than out of
Mr. Vincy the father’s pocket. For they say he’s been losing money
for years, though nobody would think so, to see him go coursing and
keeping open house as they do. And I’ve heard say Mr. Bulstrode
condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond anything for her flightiness, and
spoiling her children so.”!</p>
<p>“What’s Bulstrode to me? I don’t bank with him.”</p>
<p>“Well, Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy’s own sister, and they do say
that Mr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see
yourself, brother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always
flying, and that light way of laughing at everything, it’s very
unbecoming. But indulging your children is one thing, and finding
money to pay their debts is another. And it’s openly said that
young Vincy has raised money on his expectations. I don’t say what
expectations. Miss Garth hears me, and is welcome to tell again. I
know young people hang together.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,” said Mary Garth. “I dislike hearing
scandal too much to wish to repeat it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of his stick and made a brief
convulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as
an old whist-player’s chuckle over a bad hand. Still looking at the
fire, he said—</p>
<p>“And who pretends to say Fred Vincy hasn’t got expectations?
Such a fine, spirited fellow is like enough to have ’em.”</p>
<p>There was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when she
did so, her voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears,
though her face was still dry.</p>
<p>“Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my
brother Solomon to hear your name made free with, and your
complaint being such as may carry you off sudden, and people who
are no more Featherstones than the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly
reckoning on your property coming to <i>them</i>. And me your own
sister, and Solomon your own brother! And if that's to be it, what
has it pleased the Almighty to make families for?" Here Mrs.
Waule's tears fell, but with moderation.</p>
<p>“Come, out with it, Jane!” said Mr. Featherstone, looking at
her. “You mean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to
advance him money on what he says he knows about my will, eh?”</p>
<p>“I never said so, brother” (Mrs. Waule’s voice had again become
dry and unshaken). “It was told me by my brother Solomon last night
when he called coming from market to give me advice about the old
wheat, me being a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty,
though steady beyond anything. And he had it from most undeniable
authority, and not one, but many.”</p>
<p>“Stuff and nonsense! I don’t believe a word of it. It’s all a
got-up story. Go to the window, missy; I thought I heard a horse.
See if the doctor’s coming.”</p>
<p>“Not got up by me, brother, nor yet by Solomon, who, whatever
else he may be—and I don’t deny he has oddities—has made his will
and parted his property equal between such kin as he’s friends
with; though, for my part, I think there are times when some should
be considered more than others. But Solomon makes it no secret what
he means to do.”</p>
<p>“The more fool he!” said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty;
breaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Mary Garth to
stand near him, so that she did not find out whose horses they were
which presently paused stamping on the gravel before the door.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Featherstone’s cough was quiet, Rosamond entered,
bearing up her riding-habit with much grace. She bowed
ceremoniously to Mrs. Waule, who said stiffly, “How do you do,
miss?” smiled and nodded silently to Mary, and remained standing
till the coughing should cease, and allow her uncle to notice
her.</p>
<p>“Heyday, miss!” he said at last, “you have a fine color. Where’s
Fred?”</p>
<p>“Seeing about the horses. He will be in presently.”</p>
<p>“Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you’d better go.”</p>
<p>Even those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old
fox, had never accused him of being insincerely polite, and his
sister was quite used to the peculiar absence of ceremony with
which he marked his sense of blood-relationship. Indeed, she
herself was accustomed to think that entire freedom from the
necessity of behaving agreeably was included in the Almighty’s
intentions about families. She rose slowly without any sign of
resentment, and said in her usual muffled monotone, “Brother, I
hope the new doctor will be able to do something for you. Solomon
says there’s great talk of his cleverness. I’m sure it’s my wish
you should be spared. And there’s none more ready to nurse you than
your own sister and your own nieces, if you’d only say the word.
There’s Rebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, I remember—you’ll see I’ve remembered ’em all—all dark
and ugly. They’d need have some money, eh? There never was any
beauty in the women of our family; but the Featherstones have
always had some money, and the Waules too. Waule had money too. A
warm man was Waule. Ay, ay; money’s a good egg; and if you ’ve got
money to leave behind you, lay it in a warm nest. Good-by, Mrs.
Waule.” Here Mr. Featherstone pulled at both sides of his wig as if
he wanted to deafen himself, and his sister went away ruminating on
this oracular speech of his. Notwithstanding her jealousy of the
Vincys and of Mary Garth, there remained as the nethermost sediment
in her mental shallows a persuasion that her brother Peter
Featherstone could never leave his chief property away from his
blood-relations:—else, why had the Almighty carried off his two
wives both childless, after he had gained so much by manganese and
things, turning up when nobody expected it?—and why was there a
Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all sit ting in
the same pew for generations, and the Featherstone pew next to
them, if, the Sunday after her brother Peter’s death, everybody was
to know that the property was gone out of the family? The human
mind has at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so preposterous a
result was not strictly conceivable. But we are frightened at much
that is not strictly conceivable.</p>
<p>When Fred came in the old man eyed him with a peculiar twinkle,
which the younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the
satisfactory details of his appearance.</p>
<p>“You two misses go away,” said Mr. Featherstone. “I want to
speak to Fred.”</p>
<p>“Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a
little while,” said Mary. The two girls had not only known each
other in childhood, but had been at the same provincial school
together (Mary as an articled pupil), so that they had many
memories in common, and liked very well to talk in private. Indeed,
this tete-a-tete was one of Rosamond’s objects in coming to Stone
Court.</p>
<p>Old Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the door had
been closed. He continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and
with one of his habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and
widening his mouth; and when he spoke, it was in a low tone, which
might be taken for that of an informer ready to be bought off,
rather than for the tone of an offended senior. He was not a man to
feel any strong moral indignation even on account of trespasses
against himself. It was natural that others should want to get an
advantage over him, but then, he was a little too cunning for
them.</p>
<p>“So, sir, you’ve been paying ten per cent for money which you’ve
promised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I’m dead and gone,
eh? You put my life at a twelvemonth, say. But I can alter my will
yet.”</p>
<p>Fred blushed. He had not borrowed money in that way, for
excellent reasons. But he was conscious of having spoken with some
confidence (perhaps with more than he exactly remembered) about his
prospect of getting Featherstone’s land as a future means of paying
present debts.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you refer to, sir. I have certainly never
borrowed any money on such an insecurity. Please to explain.”</p>
<p>“No, sir, it’s you must explain. I can alter my will yet, let me
tell you. I’m of sound mind—can reckon compound interest in my
head, and remember every fool’s name as well as I could twenty
years ago. What the deuce? I’m under eighty. I say, you must
contradict this story.”</p>
<p>“I have contradicted it, sir,” Fred answered, with a touch of
impatience, not remembering that his uncle did not verbally
discriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was
further from confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who
often wondered that so many fools took his own assertions for
proofs. “But I contradict it again. The story is a silly lie.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! you must bring dockiments. It comes from
authority.”</p>
<p>“Name the authority, and make him name the man of whom I
borrowed the money, and then I can disprove the story.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty good authority, I think—a man who knows most of
what goes on in Middlemarch. It’s that fine, religious, charitable
uncle o’ yours. Come now!” Here Mr. Featherstone had his peculiar
inward shake which signified merriment.</p>
<p>“Mr. Bulstrode?”</p>
<p>“Who else, eh?”</p>
<p>“Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing
words he may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he named
the man who lent me the money?”</p>
<p>“If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him.
But, supposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn’t get
it—Bulstrode ’ud know that too. You bring me a writing from
Bulstrode to say he doesn’t believe you’ve ever promised to pay
your debts out o’ my land. Come now!”</p>
<p>Mr. Featherstone’s face required its whole scale of grimaces as
a muscular outlet to his silent triumph in the soundness of his
faculties.</p>
<p>Fred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.</p>
<p>“You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men,
believes scores of things that are not true, and he has a prejudice
against me. I could easily get him to write that he knew no facts
in proof of the report you speak of, though it might lead to
unpleasantness. But I could hardly ask him to write down what he
believes or does not believe about me.” Fred paused an instant, and
then added, in politic appeal to his uncle’s vanity, “That is
hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.” But he was disappointed in
the result.</p>
<p>“Ay, I know what you mean. You’d sooner offend me than
Bulstrode. And what’s he?—he’s got no land hereabout that ever I
heard tell of. A speckilating fellow! He may come down any day,
when the devil leaves off backing him. And that’s what his religion
means: he wants God A’mighty to come in. That’s nonsense! There’s
one thing I made out pretty clear when I used to go to church—and
it’s this: God A’mighty sticks to the land. He promises land, and
He gives land, and He makes chaps rich with corn and cattle. But
you take the other side. You like Bulstrode and speckilation better
than Featherstone and land.”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Fred, rising, standing with his
back to the fire and beating his boot with his whip. “I like
neither Bulstrode nor speculation.” He spoke rather sulkily,
feeling himself stalemated.</p>
<p>“Well, well, you can do without me, that’s pretty clear,” said
old Featherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred
would show himself at all independent. “You neither want a bit of
land to make a squire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a
lift of a hundred pound by the way. It’s all one to me. I can make
five codicils if I like, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a
nest-egg. It’s all one to me.”</p>
<p>Fred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him presents
of money, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with
the immediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant
prospect of the land.</p>
<p>“I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for
any kind intentions you might have towards me. On the
contrary.”</p>
<p>“Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode
saying he doesn’t believe you’ve been cracking and promising to pay
your debts out o’ my land, and then, if there’s any scrape you’ve
got into, we’ll see if I can’t back you a bit. Come now! That’s a
bargain. Here, give me your arm. I’ll try and walk round the
room.”</p>
<p>Fred, in spite of his irritation, had kindness enough in him to
be a little sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with
his dropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking.
While giving his arm, he thought that he should not himself like to
be an old fellow with his constitution breaking up; and he waited
good-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks
about the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the
scanty book-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were
Josephus, Culpepper, Klopstock’s “Messiah,“ and several volumes of
the ”Gentleman’s Magazine.“</p>
<p>“Read me the names o’ the books. Come now! you’re a college
man.”</p>
<p>Fred gave him the titles.</p>
<p>“What did missy want with more books? What must you be bringing
her more books for?”</p>
<p>“They amuse her, sir. She is very fond of reading.”</p>
<p>“A little too fond,” said Mr. Featherstone, captiously. “She was
for reading when she sat with me. But I put a stop to that. She’s
got the newspaper to read out loud. That’s enough for one day, I
should think. I can’t abide to see her reading to herself. You mind
and not bring her any more books, do you hear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I hear.” Fred had received this order before, and had
secretly disobeyed it. He intended to disobey it again.</p>
<p>“Ring the bell,” said Mr. Featherstone; “I want missy to come
down.”</p>
<p>Rosamond and Mary had been talking faster than their male
friends. They did not think of sitting down, but stood at the
toilet-table near the window while Rosamond took off her hat,
adjusted her veil, and applied little touches of her finger-tips to
her hair—hair of infantine fairness, neither flaxen nor yellow.
Mary Garth seemed all the plainer standing at an angle between the
two nymphs—the one in the glass, and the one out of it, who looked
at each other with eyes of heavenly blue, deep enough to hold the
most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder could put into them,
and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner if these should
happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in Middlemarch
looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure displayed
by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most men in
Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the best
girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on the
contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her
curly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it
would not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she
had all the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and
vices quite as much as beauty; it is apt either to feign
amiability, or, not feigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of
discontent: at any rate, to be called an ugly thing in contrast
with that lovely creature your companion, is apt to produce some
effect beyond a sense of fine veracity and fitness in the phrase.
At the age of two-and-twenty Mary had certainly not attained that
perfect good sense and good principle which are usually recommended
to the less fortunate girl, as if they were to be obtained in
quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of resignation as required.
Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric bitterness continually
renewed and never carried utterly out of sight, except by a strong
current of gratitude towards those who, instead of telling her that
she ought to be contented, did something to make her so. Advancing
womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good human
sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in
all latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt
would have painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad
features look out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For
honesty, truth-telling fairness, was Mary’s reigning virtue: she
neither tried to create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own
behoof, and when she was in a good mood she had humor enough in her
to laugh at herself. When she and Rosamond happened both to be
reflected in the glass, she said, laughingly—</p>
<p>“What a brown patch I am by the side of you, Rosy! You are the
most unbecoming companion.”</p>
<p>“Oh no! No one thinks of your appearance, you are so sensible
and useful, Mary. Beauty is of very little consequence in reality,”
said Rosamond, turning her head towards Mary, but with eyes
swerving towards the new view of her neck in the glass.</p>
<p>“You mean my beauty,” said Mary, rather sardonically.</p>
<p>Rosamond thought, “Poor Mary, she takes the kindest things ill.”
Aloud she said, “What have you been doing lately?”</p>
<p>“I? Oh, minding the house—pouring out syrup—pretending to be
amiable and contented—learning to have a bad opinion of
everybody.”</p>
<p>“It is a wretched life for you.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her head. ”I
think my life is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan’s.“</p>
<p>“Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.”</p>
<p>“She is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all
sure that everything gets easier as one gets older.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Rosamond, reflectively; ”one wonders what such people
do, without any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a
support. But,“ she added, dimpling, ”it is very different with
you,’Mary. You may have an offer.“</p>
<p>“Has any one told you he means to make me one?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in
love with you, seeing you almost every day.”</p>
<p>A certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the
resolve not to show any change.</p>
<p>“Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered,
carelessly; “it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting
each other.”</p>
<p>“Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr.
Lydgate is both.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into
indifference. “You want to know something about him,” she added,
not choosing to indulge Rosamond’s indirectness.</p>
<p>“Merely, how you like him.”</p>
<p>“There is no question of liking at present. My liking always
wants some little kindness to kindle it. I am not magnanimous
enough to like people who speak to me without seeming to see
me.”</p>
<p>“Is he so haughty?” said Rosamond, with heightened satisfaction.
“You know that he is of good family?”</p>
<p>“No; he did not give that as a reason.”</p>
<p>“Mary! you are the oddest girl. But what sort of looking man is
he? Describe him to me.”</p>
<p>“How can one describe a man? I can give you an inventory: heavy
eyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid
white hands—and—let me see—oh, an exquisite cambric
pocket-handkerchief. But you will see him. You know this is about
the time of his visits.”</p>
<p>Rosamond blushed a little, but said, meditatively, “I rather
like a haughty manner. I cannot endure a rattling young man.”</p>
<p>“I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty; but il y en a
pour tous les gouts, as little Mamselle used to say, and if any
girl can choose the particular sort of conceit she would like, I
should think it is you, Rosy.”</p>
<p>“Haughtiness is not conceit; I call Fred conceited.”</p>
<p>“I wish no one said any worse of him. He should be more careful.
Mrs. Waule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady.” Mary
spoke from a girlish impulse which got the better of her judgment.
There was a vague uneasiness associated with the word “unsteady“
which she hoped Rosamond might say something to dissipate. But she
purposely abstained from mentioning Mrs. Waule’s more special
insinuation.</p>
<p>“Oh, Fred is horrid!” said Rosamond. She would not have allowed
herself so unsuitable a word to any one but Mary.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by horrid?”</p>
<p>“He is so idle, and makes papa so angry, and says he will not
take orders.”</p>
<p>“I think Fred is quite right.”</p>
<p>“How can you say he is quite right, Mary? I thought you had more
sense of religion.”</p>
<p>“He is not fit to be a clergyman.”</p>
<p>“But he ought to be fit.”—”Well, then, he is not what he ought
to be. I know some other people who are in the same case.“</p>
<p>“But no one approves of them. I should not like to marry a
clergyman; but there must be clergymen.”</p>
<p>“It does not follow that Fred must be one.”</p>
<p>“But when papa has been at the expense of educating him for it!
And only suppose, if he should have no fortune left him?”</p>
<p>“I can suppose that very well,” said Mary, dryly.</p>
<p>“Then I wonder you can defend Fred,” said Rosamond, inclined to
push this point.</p>
<p>“I don’t defend him,” said Mary, laughing; “I would defend any
parish from having him for a clergyman.”</p>
<p>“But of course if he were a clergyman, he must be
different.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he would be a great hypocrite; and he is not that
yet.”</p>
<p>“It is of no use saying anything to you, Mary. You always take
Fred’s part.”</p>
<p>“Why should I not take his part?” said Mary, lighting up. “He
would take mine. He is the only person who takes the least trouble
to oblige me.”</p>
<p>“You make me feel very uncomfortable, Mary,” said Rosamond, with
her gravest mildness; “I would not tell mamma for the world.”</p>
<p>“What would you not tell her?” said Mary, angrily.</p>
<p>“Pray do not go into a rage, Mary,” said Rosamond, mildly as
ever.</p>
<p>“If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell
her that I would not marry him if he asked me. But he is not going
to do so, that I am aware. He certainly never has asked me.”</p>
<p>“Mary, you are always so violent.”</p>
<p>“And you are always so exasperating.”</p>
<p>“I? What can you blame me for?”</p>
<p>“Oh, blameless people are always the most exasperating. There is
the bell—I think we must go down.”</p>
<p>“I did not mean to quarrel,” said Rosamond, putting on her
hat.</p>
<p>“Quarrel? Nonsense; we have not quarrelled. If one is not to get
into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?”</p>
<p>“Am I to repeat what you have said?” “Just as you please. I
never say what I am afraid of having repeated. But let us go
down.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors
stayed long enough to see him; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond
to sing to him, and she herself was so kind as to propose a second
favorite song of his—“Flow on, thou shining river”—after she had
sung “Home, sweet home” (which she detested). This hard-headed old
Overreach approved of the sentimental song, as the suitable garnish
for girls, and also as fundamentally fine, sentiment being the
right thing for a song.</p>
<p>Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and
assuring missy that her voice was as clear as a blackbird’s, when
Mr. Lydgate’s horse passed the window.</p>
<p>His dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an
aged patient—who can hardly believe that medicine would not “set
him up” if the doctor were only clever enough—added to his general
disbelief in Middlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background
to this vision of Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste
ostentatiously to introduce as his niece, though he had never
thought it worth while to speak of Mary Garth in that light.
Nothing escaped Lydgate in Rosamond’s graceful behavior: how
delicately she waived the notice which the old man’s want of taste
had thrust upon her by a quiet gravity, not showing her dimples on
the wrong occasion, but showing them afterwards in speaking to
Mary, to whom she addressed herself with so much good-natured
interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining Mary more fully
than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in Rosamond’s
eyes. But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper.</p>
<p>“Miss Rosy has been singing me a song—you’ve nothing to say
against that, eh, doctor?” said Mr. Featherstone. “I like it better
than your physic.”</p>
<p>“That has made me forget how the time was going,” said Rosamond,
rising to reach her hat, which she had laid aside before singing,
so that her flower-like head on its white stem was seen in
perfection above-her riding-habit. “Fred, we must really go.”</p>
<p>“Very good,” said Fred, who had his own reasons for not being in
the best spirits, and wanted to get away.</p>
<p>“Miss Vincy is a musician?” said Lydgate, following her with his
eyes. (Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the
consciousness that she was being looked at. She was by nature an
actress of parts that entered into her physique: she even acted her
own character, and so well, that she did not know it to be
precisely her own.)</p>
<p>“The best in Middlemarch, I’ll be bound,” said Mr. Featherstone,
“let the next be who she will. Eh, Fred? Speak up for your
sister.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’m out of court, sir. My evidence would be good for
nothing.”</p>
<p>“Middlemarch has not a very high standard, uncle,” said
Rosamond, with a pretty lightness, going towards her whip, which
lay at a distance.</p>
<p>Lydgate was quick in anticipating her. He reached the whip
before she did, and turned to present it to her. She bowed and
looked at him: he of course was looking at her, and their eyes met
with that peculiar meeting which is never arrived at by effort, but
seems like a sudden divine clearance of haze. I think Lydgate
turned a little paler than usual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and
felt a certain astonishment. After that, she was really anxious to
go, and did not know what sort of stupidity her uncle was talking
of when she went to shake hands with him.</p>
<p>Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression,
called falling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated
beforehand. Ever since that important new arrival in Middlemarch
she had woven a little future, of which something like this scene
was the necessary beginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and
clinging to a raft, or duly escorted and accompanied by
portmanteaus, have always had a circumstantial fascination for the
virgin mind, against which native merit has urged itself in vain.
And a stranger was absolutely necessary to Rosamond’s social
romance, which had always turned on a lover and bridegroom who was
not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at all like her
own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand that he
should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the
stranger had met, reality proved much more moving than
anticipation, and Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great
epoch of her life. She judged of her own symptoms as those of
awakening love, and she held it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate
should have fallen in love at first sight of her. These things
happened so often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when
the complexion showed all the better for it? Rosamond, though no
older than Mary, was rather used to being fallen in love with; but
she, for her part, had remained indifferent and fastidiously
critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor. And here was
Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being altogether
foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of distinction
congruous with good family, and possessing connections which
offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of talent,
also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in fact, a
man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid
interest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be“
such as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.</p>
<p>Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were
preoccupied and inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for
her structure had the usual airy slightness, was of remarkably
detailed and realistic imagination when the foundation had been
once presupposed; and before they had ridden a mile she was far on
in the costume and introductions of her wedded life, having
determined on her house in Middle-march, and foreseen the visits
she would pay to her husband’s high-bred relatives at a distance,
whose finished manners she could appropriate as thoroughly as she
had done her school accomplishments, preparing herself thus for
vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There was nothing
financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared about
what were considered refinements, and not about the money that was
to pay for them.</p>
<p>Fred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which
even his ready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no
way of eluding Featherstone’s stupid demand without incurring
consequences which he liked less even than the task of fulfilling
it. His father was already out of humor with him, and would be
still more so if he were the occasion of any additional coolness
between his own family and the Bulstrodes. Then, he himself hated
having to go and speak to his uncle Bulstrode, and perhaps after
drinking wine he had said many foolish things about Featherstone’s
property, and these had been magnified by report. Fred felt that he
made a wretched figure as a fellow who bragged about expectations
from a queer old miser like Featherstone, and went to beg for
certificates at his bidding. But—those expectations! He really had
them, and he saw no agreeable alternative if he gave them up;
besides, he had lately made a debt which galled him extremely, and
old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off. The whole
affair was miserably small: his debts were small, even his
expectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred had known
men to whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness
of his scrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of
misanthropic bitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch
manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular, while
such men as Mainwaring and Vyan—certainly life was a poor business,
when a spirited young fellow, with a good appetite for the best of
everything, had so poor an outlook.</p>
<p>It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode’s
name in the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone’s; nor could
this have made any difference to his position. He saw plainly
enough that the old man wanted to exercise his power by tormenting
him a little, and also probably to get some satisfaction out of
seeing him on unpleasant terms with Bulstrode. Fred fancied that he
saw to the bottom of his uncle Featherstone’s soul, though in
reality half what he saw there was no more than the reflex of his
own inclinations. The difficult task of knowing another soul is not
for young gentlemen whose consciousness is chiefly made up of their
own wishes.</p>
<p>Fred’s main point of debate with himself was, whether he should
tell his father, or try to get through the affair without his
father’s knowledge. It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking
about him; and if Mary Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule’s report to
Rosamond, it would be sure to reach his father, who would as surely
question him about it. He said to Rosamond, as they slackened their
pace—</p>
<p>“Rosy, did Mary tell you that Mrs. Waule had said anything about
me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, she did.”</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>“That you were very unsteady.”</p>
<p>“Was that all?”</p>
<p>“I should think that was enough, Fred.”</p>
<p>“You are sure she said no more?”</p>
<p>“Mary mentioned nothing else. But really, Fred, I think you
ought to be ashamed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, fudge! Don’t lecture me. What did Mary say about it?”</p>
<p>“I am not obliged to tell you. You care so very much what Mary
says, and you are too rude to allow me to speak.”</p>
<p>“Of course I care what Mary says. She is the best girl I
know.”</p>
<p>“I should never have thought she was a girl to fall in love
with.”</p>
<p>“How do you know what men would fall in love with? Girls never
know.”</p>
<p>“At least, Fred, let me advise <i>you</i> not to fall in love
with her, for she says she would not marry you if you asked
her."</p>
<p>“She might have waited till I did ask her.”</p>
<p>“I knew it would nettle you, Fred.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. She would not have said so if you had not provoked
her.” Before reaching home, Fred concluded that he would tell the
whole affair as simply as possible to his father, who might perhaps
take on himself the unpleasant business of speaking to
Bulstrode.</p>
