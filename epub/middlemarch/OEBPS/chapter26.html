<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">B</span>ut Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons
that were quite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary
Houndsley streets in search of Diamond, he had brought back not
only a bad bargain in horse-flesh, but the further misfortune of
some ailment which for a day or two had deemed mere depression and
headache, but which got so much worse when he returned from his
visit to Stone Court that, going into the dining-room, he threw
himself on the sofa, and in answer to his mother's anxious
question, said, "I feel very ill: I think you must send for
Wrench."</p>
<p>Wrench came, but did not apprehend anything serious, spoke of a
“slight derangement,” and did not speak of coming again on the
morrow. He had a due value for the Vincys’ house, but the wariest
men are apt to be dulled by routine, and on worried mornings will
sometimes go through their business with the zest of the daily
bell-ringer. Mr. Wrench was a small, neat, bilious man, with a
well-dressed wig: he had a laborious practice, an irascible temper,
a lymphatic wife and seven children; and he was already rather late
before setting out on a four-miles drive to meet Dr. Minchin on the
other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a rural practitioner,
having increased Middlemarch practice in that direction. Great
statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Mr. Wrench did not
neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time had black
and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to poor
Fred, who, however, unwilling as he said to believe that he was “in
for an illness,” rose at his usual easy hour the next morning and
went down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but
in sitting and shivering by the fire. Mr. Wrench was again sent
for, but was gone on his rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her
darling’s changed looks and general misery, began to cry and said
she would send for Dr. Sprague.</p>
<p>“Oh, nonsense, mother! It’s nothing,” said Fred, putting out his
hot dry hand to her, “I shall soon be all right. I must have taken
cold in that nasty damp ride.”</p>
<p>“Mamma!“ said Rosamond, who was seated near the window (the
dining-room windows looked on that highly respectable street called
Lowick Gate), ”there is Mr. Lydgate, stopping to speak to some one.
If I were you I would call him in. He has cured Ellen Bulstrode.
They say he cures every one.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant,
thinking only of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Lydgate was
only two yards off on the other side of some iron palisading, and
turned round at the sudden sound of the sash, before she called to
him. In two minutes he was in the room, and Rosamond went out,
after waiting just long enough to show a pretty anxiety conflicting
with her sense of what was becoming.</p>
<p>Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy’s mind
insisted with remarkable instinct on every point of minor
importance, especially on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said
about coming again. That there might be an awkward affair with
Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but the ease was serious enough to
make him dismiss that consideration: he was convinced that Fred was
in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever, and that he had taken
just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed immediately, must have
a regular nurse, and various appliances and precautions must be
used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs. Vincy’s terror
at these indications of danger found vent in such words as came
most easily. She thought it “very ill usage on the part of Mr.
Wrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to
Mr. Peacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr.
Wrench should neglect her children more than others, she could not
for the life of her understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher’s
when they had the measles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished
that he should. And if anything should happen—”</p>
<p>Here poor Mrs. Vincy’s spirit quite broke down, and her Niobe
throat and good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the
hall out of Fred’s hearing, but Rosamond had opened the
drawing-room door, and now came forward anxiously. Lydgate
apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that the symptoms yesterday might
have been disguising, and that this form of fever was very
equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately to the
druggist’s and have a prescription made up in order to lose no
time, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been
done.</p>
<p>“But you must come again—you must go on attending Fred. I can’t
have my boy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody
ill-will, thank God, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but
he’d better have let me die—if—if—”</p>
<p>“I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?” said Lydgate,
really believing that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely
with a case of this kind.</p>
<p>“Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, coming
to her mother’s aid, and supporting her arm to lead her away.</p>
<p>When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did
not care if he never came into his house again. Lydgate should go
on now, whether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have
fever in the house. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to
dinner on Thursday. And Pritchard needn’t get up any wine: brandy
was the best thing against infection. “I shall drink brandy,” added
Mr. Vincy, emphatically—as much as to say, this was not an occasion
for firing with blank-cartridges. “He’s an uncommonly unfortunate
lad, is Fred. He’d need have—some luck by-and-by to make up for all
this—else I don’t know who’d have an eldest son.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say so, Vincy,” said the mother, with a quivering lip,
“if you don’t want him to be taken from me.”</p>
<p>“It will worret you to death, Lucy; <i>that</i> I can see," said
Mr. Vincy, more mildly. "However, Wrench shall know what I think of
the matter." (What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that the fever
might somehow have been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper
solicitude about his—the Mayor's—family.) "I'm the last man to give
in to the cry about new doctors, or new parsons either—whether
they're Bulstrode's men or not. But Wrench shall know what I think,
take it as he will."</p>
<p>Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he
could be in his offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed
you at a disadvantage is only an additional exasperation,
especially if he happens to have been an object of dislike
beforehand. Country practitioners used to be an irritable species,
susceptible on the point of honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the
most irritable among them. He did not refuse to meet Lydgate in the
evening, but his temper was somewhat tried on the occasion. He had
to hear Mrs. Vincy say—</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me
so?— To go away, and never to come again! And my boy might have
been stretched a corpse!”</p>
<p>Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy
Infection, and was a good deal heated in consequence, started up
when he heard Wrench come in, and went into the hall to let him
know what he thought.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,” said the
Mayor, who of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official
air, and how broadened himself by putting his thumbs in his
armholes.— “To let fever get unawares into a house like this. There
are some things that ought to be actionable, and are not so— that’s
my opinion.”</p>
<p>But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of
being instructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like
Lydgate, inwardly considered him in need of instruction, for “in
point of fact,” Mr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded
flighty, foreign notions, which would not wear. He swallowed his
ire for the moment, but he afterwards wrote to decline further
attendance in the case. The house might be a good one, but Mr.
Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody on a professional
matter. He reflected, with much probability on his side, that
Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his
ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his
professional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw
out biting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to
get himself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That
cant about cures was never got up by sound practitioners.</p>
<p>This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench
could desire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating,
but perilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the
weather-prophet. He was impatient of the foolish expectations
amidst which all work must be carried on, and likely enough to
damage himself as much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an
unprofessional openness.</p>
<p>However, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the
Vincys, and the event was a subject of general conversation in
Middlemarch. Some said, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously,
that Mr. Vincy had threatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had
accused him of poisoning her son. Others were of opinion that Mr.
Lydgate’s passing by was providential, that he was wonderfully
clever in fevers, and that Bulstrode was in the right to bring him
forward. Many people believed that Lydgate’s coming to the town at
all was really due to Bulstrode; and Mrs. Taft, who was always
counting stitches and gathered her information in misleading
fragments caught between the rows of her knitting, had got it into
her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son of Bulstrode’s, a fact
which seemed to justify her suspicions of evangelical laymen.</p>
<p>She one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs.
Farebrother, who did not fail to tell her son of it, observing—</p>
<p>“I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I
should be sorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.”</p>
<p>“Why, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh,
“you know very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North.
He never heard of Bulstrode before he came here.”</p>
<p>“That is satisfactory so far as Mr. Lydgate is concerned,
Camden,” said the old lady, with an air of precision.—“But as to
Bulstrode—the report may be true of some other son.”</p>
