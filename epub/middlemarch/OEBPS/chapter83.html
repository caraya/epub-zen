<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">On</span> the second morning after Dorothea's visit to Rosamond, she
had had two nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces
of fatigue, but felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous
strength—that is to say, more strength than she could manage to
concentrate on any occupation. The day before, she had taken long
walks outside the grounds, and had paid two visits to the
Parsonage; but she never in her life told any one the reason why
she spent her time in that fruitless manner, and this morning she
was rather angry with herself for her childish restlessness. To-day
was to be spent quite differently. What was there to be done in the
village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was well and had flannel;
nobody's pig had died; and it was Saturday morning, when there was
a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones, and when it was
useless to go into the school. But there were various subjects that
Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she resolved to throw
herself energetically into the gravest of all. She sat down in the
library before her particular little heap of books on political
economy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get
light as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure
one's neighbors, or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them
the most good. Here was a weighty subject which, if she could but
lay hold of it, would certainly keep her mind steady. Unhappily her
mind slipped off it for a whole hour; and at the end she found
herself reading sentences twice over with an intense consciousness
of many things, but not of any one thing contained in the text.
This was hopeless. Should she order the carriage and drive to
Tipton? No; for some reason or other she preferred staying at
Lowick. But her vagrant mind must be reduced to order: there was an
art in self-discipline; and she walked round and round the brown
library considering by what sort of manoeuvre she could arrest her
wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the best
means—something to which she must go doggedly. Was there not the
geography of Asia Minor, in which her slackness had often been
rebuked by Mr. Casaubon? She went to the cabinet of maps and
unrolled one: this morning she might make herself finally sure that
Paphlagonia was not on the Levantine coast, and fix her total
darkness about the Chalybes firmly on the shores of the Euxine. A
map was a fine thing to study when you were disposed to think of
something else, being made up of names that would turn into a chime
if you went back upon them. Dorothea set earnestly to work, bending
close to her map, and uttering the names in an audible, subdued
tone, which often got into a chime. She looked amusingly girlish
after all her deep experience—nodding her head and marking the
names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip, and now
and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face and
say, "Oh dear! oh dear!"</p>
<p>There was no reason why this should end any more than a
merry-go-round; but it was at last interrupted by the opening of
the door and the announcement of Miss Noble.</p>
<p>The little old lady, whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea’s
shoulder, was warmly welcomed, but while her hand was being pressed
she made many of her beaver-like noises, as if she had something
difficult to say.</p>
<p>“Do sit down,” said Dorothea, rolling a chair forward. “Am I
wanted for anything? I shall be so glad if I can do anything.”</p>
<p>“I will not stay,” said Miss Noble, putting her hand into her
small basket, and holding some article inside it nervously; “I have
left a friend in the churchyard.” She lapsed into her inarticulate
sounds, and unconsciously drew forth the article which she was
fingering. It was the tortoise-shell lozenge-box, and Dorothea felt
the color mounting to her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ladislaw,” continued the timid little woman. “He fears he
has offended you, and has begged me to ask if you will see him for
a few minutes.”</p>
<p>Dorothea did not answer on the instant: it was crossing her mind
that she could not receive him in this library, where her husband’s
prohibition seemed to dwell. She looked towards the window. Could
she go out and meet him in the grounds? The sky was heavy, and the
trees had begun to shiver as at a coming storm. Besides, she shrank
from going out to him.</p>
<p>“Do see him, Mrs. Casaubon,” said Miss Noble, pathetically;
“else I must go back and say No, and that will hurt him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will see him,” said Dorothea. “Pray tell him to
come.”</p>
<p>What else was there to be done? There was nothing that she
longed for at that moment except to see Will: the possibility of
seeing him had thrust itself insistently between her and every
other object; and yet she had a throbbing excitement like an alarm
upon her—a sense that she was doing something daringly defiant for
his sake.</p>
<p>When the little lady had trotted away on her mission, Dorothea
stood in the middle of the library with her hands falling clasped
before her, making no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of
dignified unconsciousness. What she was least conscious of just
then was her own body: she was thinking of what was likely to be in
Will’s mind, and of the hard feelings that others had had about
him. How could any duty bind her to hardness? Resistance to unjust
dispraise had mingled with her feeling for him from the very first,
and now in the rebound of her heart after her anguish the
resistance was stronger than ever. “If I love him too much it is
because he has been used so ill:”—there was a voice within her
saying this to some imagined audience in the library, when the door
was opened, and she saw Will before her.</p>
<p>She did not move, and he came towards her with more doubt and
timidity in his face than she had ever seen before. He was in a
state of uncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word
of his should condemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea
was afraid of her <i>own</i> emotion. She looked as if there were a
spell upon her, keeping her motionless and hindering her from
unclasping her hands, while some intense, grave yearning was
imprisoned within her eyes. Seeing that she did not put out her
hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her and said with
embarrassment, "I am so grateful to you for seeing me."</p>
<p>“I wanted to see you,” said Dorothea, having no other words at
command. It did not occur to her to sit down, and Will did not give
a cheerful interpretation to this queenly way of receiving him; but
he went on to say what he had made up his mind to say.</p>
<p>“I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back
so soon. I have been punished for my impatience. You know—every one
knows now—a painful story about my parentage. I knew of it before I
went away, and I always meant to tell you of it if—if we ever met
again.”</p>
<p>There was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she unclasped her
hands, but immediately folded them over each other.</p>
<p>“But the affair is matter of gossip now,” Will continued. “I
wished you to know that something connected with it—something which
happened before I went away, helped to bring me down here again. At
least I thought it excused my coming. It was the idea of getting
Bulstrode to apply some money to a public purpose—some money which
he had thought of giving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s
credit that he privately offered me compensation for an old injury:
he offered to give me a good income to make amends; but I suppose
you know the disagreeable story?”</p>
<p>Will looked doubtfully at Dorothea, but his manner was gathering
some of the defiant courage with which he always thought of this
fact in his destiny. He added, “You know that it must be altogether
painful to me.”</p>
<p>“Yes—yes—I know,” said Dorothea, hastily.</p>
<p>“I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was
sure that you would not think well of me if I did so,” said Will.
Why should he mind saying anything of that sort to her now? She
knew that he had avowed his love for her. “I felt that”—he broke
off, nevertheless.</p>
<p>“You acted as I should have expected you to act,” said Dorothea,
her face brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on
its beautiful stem.</p>
<p>“I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my
birth create a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to
do so in others,” said Will, shaking his head backward in his old
way, and looking with a grave appeal into her eyes.</p>
<p>“If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to
cling to you,” said Dorothea, fervidly. “Nothing could have changed
me but—” her heart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she
made a great effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice,
“but thinking that you were different—not so good as I had believed
you to be.”</p>
<p>“You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but
one,” said Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of
hers. “I mean, in my truth to you. When I thought you doubted of
that, I didn’t care about anything that was left. I thought it was
all over with me, and there was nothing to try for—only things to
endure.”</p>
<p>“I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her
hand; a vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection.</p>
<p>He took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a
sob. But he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand, and
might have done for the portrait of a Royalist. Still it was
difficult to loose the hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a
confusion that distressed her, looked and moved away.</p>
<p>“See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are
tossed,” she said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and
moving with only a dim sense of what she was doing.</p>
<p>Will followed her at a little distance, and leaned against the
tall back of a leather chair, on which he ventured now to lay his
hat and gloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of
formality to which he had been for the first time condemned in
Dorothea’s presence. It must be confessed that he felt very happy
at that moment leaning on the chair. He was not much afraid of
anything that she might feel now.</p>
<p>They stood silent, not looking at each other, but looking at the
evergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale
underside of their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never
enjoyed the prospect of a storm so much: it delivered him from the
necessity of going away. Leaves and little branches were hurled
about, and the thunder was getting nearer. The light was more and
more sombre, but there came a flash of lightning which made them
start and look at each other, and then smile. Dorothea began to say
what she had been thinking of.</p>
<p>“That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had
nothing to try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other
people’s good would remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can
be happy. I seemed to see that more clearly than ever, when I was
the most wretched. I can hardly think how I could have borne the
trouble, if that feeling had not come to me to make strength.”</p>
<p>“You have never felt the sort of misery I felt,” said Will; “the
misery of knowing that you must despise me.”</p>
<p>“But I have felt worse—it was worse to think ill—” Dorothea had
begun impetuously, but broke off.</p>
<p>Will colored. He had the sense that whatever she said was
uttered in the vision of a fatality that kept them apart. He was
silent a moment, and then said passionately—</p>
<p>“We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other
without disguise. Since I must go away—since we must always be
divided—you may think of me as one on the brink of the grave.”</p>
<p>While he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning
which lit each of them up for the other—and the light seemed to be
the terror of a hopeless love. Dorothea darted instantaneously from
the window; Will followed her, seizing her hand with a spasmodic
movement; and so they stood, with their hands clasped, like two
children, looking out on the storm, while the thunder gave a
tremendous crack and roll above them, and the rain began to pour
down. Then they turned their faces towards each other, with the
memory of his last words in them, and they did not loose each
other’s hands.</p>
<p>“There is no hope for me,” said Will. “Even if you loved me as
well as I love you—even if I were everything to you—I shall most
likely always be very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count
on nothing but a creeping lot. It is impossible for us ever to
belong to each other. It is perhaps base of me to have asked for a
word from you. I meant to go away into silence, but I have not been
able to do what I meant.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be sorry,” said Dorothea, in her clear tender tones. “I
would rather share all the trouble of our parting.”</p>
<p>Her lips trembled, and so did his. It was never known which lips
were the first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed
tremblingly, and then they moved apart.</p>
<p>The rain was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry
spirit were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the
wind; it was one of those moments in which both the busy and the
idle pause with a certain awe.</p>
<p>Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman
in the middle of the room, and with her hands folded over each
other on her lap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still
an instant looking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid
his hand on hers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They
sat in that way without looking at each other, until the rain
abated and began to fall in stillness. Each had been full of
thoughts which neither of them could begin to utter.</p>
<p>But when the rain was quiet, Dorothea turned to look at Will.
With passionate exclamation, as if some torture screw were
threatening him, he started up and said, “It is impossible!”</p>
<p>He went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to
be battling with his own anger, while she looked towards him
sadly.</p>
<p>“It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides
people,” he burst out again; “it is more intolerable—to have our
life maimed by petty accidents.”</p>
<p>“No—don’t say that—your life need not be maimed,” said Dorothea,
gently.</p>
<p>“Yes, it must,” said Will, angrily. “It is cruel of you to speak
in that way—as if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the
misery of it, but I don’t. It is unkind—it is throwing back my love
for you as if it were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of
the fact. We can never be married.”</p>
<p>“Some time—we might,” said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“When?“ said Will, bitterly. ”What is the use of counting on any
success of mine? It is a mere toss up whether I shall ever do more
than keep myself decently, unless I choose to sell myself as a mere
pen and a mouthpiece. I can see that clearly enough. I could not
offer myself to any woman, even if she had no luxuries to
renounce.“</p>
<p>There was silence. Dorothea’s heart was full of something that
she wanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult. She was
wholly possessed by them: at that moment debate was mute within
her. And it was very hard that she could not say what she wanted to
say. Will was looking out of the window angrily. If he would have
looked at her and not gone away from her side, she thought
everything would have been easier. At last he turned, still resting
against the chair, and stretching his hand automatically towards
his hat, said with a sort of exasperation, “Good-by.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I cannot bear it—my heart will break,” said Dorothea,
starting from her seat, the flood of her young passion bearing down
all the obstructions which had kept her silent—the great tears
rising and falling in an instant: “I don’t mind about poverty—I
hate my wealth.”</p>
<p>In an instant Will was close to her and had his arms round her,
but she drew her head back and held his away gently that she might
go on speaking, her large tear-filled eyes looking at his very
simply, while she said in a sobbing childlike way, “We could live
quite well on my own fortune—it is too much—seven hundred a-year—I
want so little—no new clothes—and I will learn what everything
costs.”</p>
