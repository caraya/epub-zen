<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>ill Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day,
and gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. On
the contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of
drawing her husband into conversation and of deferentially
listening to him than she had ever observed in any one before. To
be sure, the listeners about Tipton were not highly gifted! Will
talked a good deal himself, but what he said was thrown in with
such rapidity, and with such an unimportant air of saying something
by the way, that it seemed a gay little chime after the great bell.
If Will was not always perfect, this was certainly one of his good
days. He described touches of incident among the poor people in
Rome, only to be seen by one who could move about freely; he found
himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the unsound opinions
of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and Catholicism;
and passed easily to a half-enthusiastic half-playful picture of
the enjoyment he got out of the very miscellaneousness of Rome,
which made the mind flexible with constant comparison, and saved
you from seeing the world's ages as a set of box-like partitions
without vital connection. Mr. Casaubon's studies, Will observed,
had always been of too broad a kind for that, and he had perhaps
never felt any such sudden effect, but for himself he confessed
that Rome had given him quite a new sense of history as a whole:
the fragments stimulated his imagination and made him constructive.
Then occasionally, but not too often, he appealed to Dorothea, and
discussed what she said, as if her sentiment were an item to be
considered in the final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or
the Laocoon. A sense of contributing to form the world's opinion
makes conversation particularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was
not without his pride in his young wife, who spoke better than most
women, as indeed he had perceived in choosing her.</p>
<p>Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon’s
statement that his labors in the Library would be suspended for a
couple of days, and that after a brief renewal he should have no
further reason for staying in Rome, encouraged Will to urge that
Mrs. Casaubon should not go away without seeing a studio or two.
Would not Mr. Casaubon take her? That sort of thing ought not to be
missed: it was quite special: it was a form of life that grew like
a small fresh vegetation with its population of insects on huge
fossils. Will would be happy to conduct them—not to anything
wearisome, only to a few examples.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him, could
not but ask her if she would be interested in such visits: he was
now at her service during the whole day; and it was agreed that
Will should come on the morrow and drive with them.</p>
<p>Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom
even Mr. Casaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he
led the way to the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he
mentioned as one of the chief renovators of Christian art, one of
those who had not only revived but expanded that grand conception
of supreme events as mysteries at which the successive ages were
spectators, and in relation to which the great souls of all periods
became as it were contemporaries. Will added that he had made
himself Naumann’s pupil for the nonce.</p>
<p>“I have been making some oil-sketches under him,” said Will. “I
hate copying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been
painting the Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been
making a sketch of Marlowe’s Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered
Kings in his Chariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I
sometimes twit him with his excess of meaning. But this time I mean
to outdo him in breadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in his
chariot for the tremendous course of the world’s physical history
lashing on the harnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good
mythical interpretation.” Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who
received this offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and
bowed with a neutral air.</p>
<p>“The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,” said
Dorothea. “I should need some explanation even of the meaning you
give. Do you intend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and
volcanoes?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Will, laughing, “and migrations of races and
clearings of forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything
you can imagine!”</p>
<p>“What a difficult kind of shorthand!” said Dorothea, smiling
towards her husband. “It would require all your knowledge to be
able to read it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. He had a suspicion that
he was being laughed at. But it was not possible to include
Dorothea in the suspicion.</p>
<p>They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was
present; his pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own
plain vivacious person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a
maroon velvet cap, so that everything was as fortunate as if he had
expected the beautiful young English lady exactly at that time.</p>
<p>The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations
on his finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr.
Casaubon as much as he did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there
with ardent words of praise, marking out particular merits in his
friend’s work; and Dorothea felt that she was getting quite new
notions as to the significance of Madonnas seated under
inexplicable canopied thrones with the simple country as a
background, and of saints with architectural models in their hands,
or knives accidentally wedged in their skulls. Some things which
had seemed monstrous to her were gathering intelligibility and even
a natural meaning: but all this was apparently a branch of
knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not interested himself.</p>
<p>“I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than
have to read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand
these pictures sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said
Dorothea, speaking to Will.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. “He will
tell you, it is all pfuscherei, which is his most opprobrious
word!”</p>
<p>“Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on
Naumann, who made a slight grimace and said—</p>
<p>“Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. His walk must
be belles-lettres. That is wi-ide.”</p>
<p>Naumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word
satirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and
Mr. Casaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German
accent, began to entertain a little respect for his judicious
severity.</p>
<p>The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will
aside for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at
Mr. Casaubon, came forward again and said—</p>
<p>“My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say
that a sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St.
Thomas Aquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so
seldom see just what I want—the idealistic in the real.”</p>
<p>“You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks
improved with a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which
I have been accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be
of any use to you in furnishing some traits for the angelical
doctor, I shall feel honored. That is to say, if the operation will
not be a lengthy one; and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the
delay.”</p>
<p>As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it
had been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and
worthiest among the sons of men. In that case her tottering faith
would have become firm again.</p>
<p>Naumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and
the sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea
sat down and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she
had done for a long while before. Every one about her seemed good,
and she said to herself that Rome, if she had only been less
ignorant, would have been full of beauty its sadness would have
been winged with hope. No nature could be less suspicious than
hers: when she was a child she believed in the gratitude of wasps
and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows, and was
proportionately indignant when their baseness was made
manifest.</p>
<p>The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about
English polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile
had perched himself on some steps in the background overlooking
all.</p>
<p>Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an
hour and take it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is
perfect so far.”</p>
<p>Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that
admiration is too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of
piteous regret—</p>
<p>“Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other
engagements—I could not ask it—or even to come again
to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. “We have nothing to do to-day
except go about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr.
Casaubon. “It would be a pity not to make the head as good as
possible.”</p>
<p>“I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon,
with polite condescension. “Having given up the interior of my head
to idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this
way.”</p>
<p>“You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and
then went on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the
sketch as if he were considering that. Putting it aside for a
moment, he looked round vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for
his visitors, and afterwards turning to Mr. Casaubon, said—</p>
<p>“Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be
unwilling to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight
sketch of her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as
a single study.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would
oblige him, and Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put
myself?”</p>
<p>Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him
to adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the
affected airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such
occasions, when the painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want
you to stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your
hand—so—looking at that stool, please, so!”</p>
<p>Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s
feet and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down
while he was adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and
desecration, and he repented that he had brought her.</p>
<p>The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about
and occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did
not in the end prevent the time from seeming long to that
gentleman, as was clear from his expressing a fear that Mrs.
Casaubon would be tired. Naumann took the hint and said—</p>
<p>“Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the
lady-wife.”</p>
<p>So Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all
it turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more
perfect if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the
morrow. On the morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once.
The result of all was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that
he arranged for the purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas
Aquinas sat among the doctors of the Church in a disputation too
abstract to be represented, but listened to with more or less
attention by an audience above. The Santa Clara, which was spoken
of in the second place, Naumann declared himself to be dissatisfied
with—he could not, in conscience, engage to make a worthy picture
of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement was
conditional.</p>
<p>I will not dwell on Naumann’s jokes at the expense of Mr.
Casaubon that evening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm,
in all which Will joined, but with a difference. No sooner did
Naumann mention any detail of Dorothea’s beauty, than Will got
exasperated at his presumption: there was grossness in his choice
of the most ordinary words, and what business had he to talk of her
lips? She was not a woman to be spoken of as other women were. Will
could not say just what he thought, but he became irritable. And
yet, when after some resistance he had consented to take the
Casaubons to his friend’s studio, he had been allured by the
gratification of his pride in being the person who could grant
Naumann such an opportunity of studying her loveliness—or rather
her divineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere
bodily prettiness were not applicable to her. (Certainly all Tipton
and its neighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been
surprised at her beauty being made so much of. In that part of the
world Miss Brooke had been only a “fine young woman.”)</p>
<p>“Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mrs. Casaubon
is not to be talked of as if she were a model,” said Will. Naumann
stared at him.</p>
<p>“Schon! I will talk of my Aquinas. The head is not a bad type,
after all. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been
flattered to have his portrait asked for. Nothing like these
starchy doctors for vanity! It was as I thought: he cared much less
for her portrait than his own.”</p>
<p>“He’s a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,” said Will, with
gnashing impetuosity. His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not
known to his hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and
wishing that he could discharge them all by a check.</p>
<p>Naumann gave a shrug and said, “It is good they go away soon, my
dear. They are spoiling your fine temper.”</p>
<p>All Will’s hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing
Dorothea when she was alone. He only wanted her to take more
emphatic notice of him; he only wanted to be something more special
in her remembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be.
He was rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, reach he
saw was her usual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman
throned out of their reach plays a great part in men’s lives, but
in most cases the worshipper longs for some queenly recognition,
some approving sign by which his soul’s sovereign may cheer him
without descending from her high place. That was precisely what
Will wanted. But there were plenty of contradictions in his
imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see how Dorothea’s eyes
turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr. Casaubon: she
would have lost some of her halo if she had been without that
duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband’s
sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and Will’s
longing to say damaging things about him was perhaps not the less
tormenting because he felt the strongest reasons for restraining
it.</p>
<p>Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he
persuaded himself that he was bound to call, and that the only
eligible time was the middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would
not be at home.</p>
<p>Dorothea, who had not been made aware that her former reception
of Will had displeased her husband, had no hesitation about seeing
him, especially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit. When
he entered she was looking at some cameos which she had been buying
for Celia. She greeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of
course, and said at once, having a cameo bracelet in her hand—</p>
<p>“I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about
cameos, and can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have
you with us in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought
there was not time. He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall
go away in three days. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray
sit down and look at them.”</p>
<p>“I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great
mistake about these little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat.
And the color is fine: it will just suit you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different
complexion. You saw her with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and
very pretty—at least I think so. We were never so long away from
each other in our lives before. She is a great pet and never was
naughty in her life. I found out before I came away that she wanted
me to buy her some cameos, and I should be sorry for them not to be
good—after their kind.” Dorothea added the last words with a
smile.</p>
<p>“You seem not to care about cameos,” said Will, seating himself
at some distance from her, and observing her while she closed the
cases.</p>
<p>“No, frankly, I don’t think them a great object in life,” said
Dorothea</p>
<p>“I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I
should have expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful
everywhere.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I am dull about many things,” said Dorothea, simply.
“I should like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And
then all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie
outside life and make it no better for the world, pains one. It
spoils my enjoyment of anything when I am made to think that most
people are shut out from it.”</p>
<p>“I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will,
impetuously. “You might say the same of landscape, of poetry, of
all refinement. If you carried it out you ought to be miserable in
your own goodness, and turn evil that you might have no advantage
over others. The best piety is to enjoy—when you can. You are doing
the most then to save the earth’s character as an agreeable planet.
And enjoyment radiates. It is of no use to try and take care of all
the world; that is being taken care of when you feel delight—in art
or in anything else. Would you turn all the youth of the world into
a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing over misery? I suspect that
you have some false belief in the virtues of misery, and want to
make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone further than he
intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea’s thought was not
taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered without
any special emotion—</p>
<p>“Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I
am never unhappy long together. I am angry and naughty—not like
Celia: I have a great outburst, and then all seems glorious again.
I cannot help believing in glorious things in a blind sort of way.
I should be quite willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so
much that I don’t know the reason of—so much that seems to me a
consecration of ugliness rather than beauty. The painting and
sculpture may be wonderful, but the feeling is often low and
brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous. Here and there I see what
takes me at once as noble—something that I might compare with the
Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian Hill; but that makes
it the greater pity that there is so little of the best kind among
all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”</p>
<p>“Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer
things want that soil to grow in.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief
current of her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do
anything good. I have often felt since I have been in Rome that
most of our lives would look much uglier and more bungling than the
pictures, if they could be put on the wall.”</p>
<p>Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more,
but changed her mind and paused.</p>
<p>“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such
thoughts,” said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head
habitual to him. “You talk as if you had never known any youth. It
is monstrous—as if you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood,
like the boy in the legend. You have been brought up in some of
those horrible notions that choose the sweetest women to
devour—like Minotaurs And now you will go and be shut up in that
stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried alive. It makes me
savage to think of it! I would rather never have seen you than
think of you with such a prospect.”</p>
<p>Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we
attach to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry
regret had so much kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had
always been giving out ardor and had never been fed with much from
the living beings around her, that she felt a new sense of
gratitude and answered with a gentle smile—</p>
<p>“It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because
you did not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another
kind of life. But Lowick is my chosen home.”</p>
<p>The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and
Will did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him
to embrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it
was clear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both
silent for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air
of saying at last what had been in her mind beforehand.</p>
<p>“I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other
day. Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I
notice that you like to put things strongly; I myself often
exaggerate when I speak hastily.”</p>
<p>“What was it?” said Will, observing that she spoke with a
timidity quite new in her. “I have a hyperbolical tongue: it
catches fire as it goes. I dare say I shall have to retract.”</p>
<p>“I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German—I
mean, for the subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been
thinking about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s
learning he must have before him the same materials as German
scholars—has he not?” Dorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct
consciousness that she was in the strange situation of consulting a
third person about the adequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.</p>
<p>“Not exactly the same materials,” said Will, thinking that he
would be duly reserved. “He is not an Orientalist, you know. He
does not profess to have more than second-hand knowledge
there.”</p>
<p>“But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were
written a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these
modern things; and they are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon’s
not be valuable, like theirs?” said Dorothea, with more remonstrant
energy. She was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she had
been having in her own mind.</p>
<p>“That depends on the line of study taken,” said Will, also
getting a tone of rejoinder. “The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen
is as changing as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making
new points of view. Who wants a system on the basis of the four
elements, or a book to refute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is
no use now to be crawling a little way after men of the last
century—men like Bryant—and correcting their mistakes?—living in a
lumber-room and furbishing up broken-legged theories about Chus and
Mizraim?”</p>
<p>“How can you bear to speak so lightly?” said Dorothea, with a
look between sorrow and anger. “If it were as you say, what could
be sadder than so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does
not affect you more painfully, if you really think that a man like
Mr. Casaubon, of so much goodness, power, and learning, should in
any way fail in what has been the labor of his best years.” She was
beginning to be shocked that she had got to such a point of
supposition, and indignant with Will for having led her to it.</p>
<p>“You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,”
said Will. “But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I
am not in a position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it
would be at best a pensioner’s eulogy.”</p>
<p>“Pray excuse me,” said Dorothea, coloring deeply. “I am aware,
as you say, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject.
Indeed, I am wrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is
much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called
a failure.”</p>
<p>“I quite agree with you,” said Will, determined to change the
situation—“so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that
risk of never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon’s generosity has
perhaps been dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it
has given me. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own
way—depend on nobody else than myself.”</p>
<p>“That is fine—I respect that feeling,” said Dorothea, with
returning kindness. “But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought
of anything in the matter except what was most for your
welfare.”</p>
<p>“She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love,
now she has married him,” said Will to himself. Aloud he said,
rising—</p>
<p>“I shall not see you again.”</p>
<p>“Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “I
am so glad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you.”?</p>
<p>“And I have made you angry,” said Will. “I have made you think
ill of me.”</p>
<p>“Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do
not say just what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of
them. In the end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for
being so impatient.”</p>
<p>“Still, you don’t like me; I have made myself an unpleasant
thought to you.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. “I
like you very much.”</p>
<p>Will was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently
have been of more importance if he had been disliked. He said
nothing, but looked dull, not to say sulky.</p>
<p>“And I am quite interested to see what you will do,” Dorothea
went on cheerfully. “I believe devoutly in a natural difference of
vocation. If it were not for that belief, I suppose I should be
very narrow—there are so many things, besides painting, that I am
quite ignorant of. You would hardly believe how little I have taken
in of music and literature, which you know so much of. I wonder
what your vocation will turn out to be: perhaps you will be a
poet?”</p>
<p>“That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to
discern that no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel,
that discernment is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety
on the chords of emotion—a soul in which knowledge passes
instantaneously into feeling, and feeling flashes back as a new
organ of knowledge. One may have that condition by fits only.”</p>
<p>“But you leave out the poems,” said Dorothea. “I think they are
wanted to complete the poet. I understand what you mean about
knowledge passing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I
experience. But I am sure I could never produce a poem.”</p>
<p>“You <i>are</i> a poem—and that is to be the best part of a
poet—what makes up the poet's consciousness in his best moods,"
said Will, showing such originality as we all share with the
morning and the spring-time and other endless renewals.</p>
<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” said Dorothea, laughing out her
words in a bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful
gratitude in her eyes. “What very kind things you say to me!”</p>
<p>“I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call
kind—that I could ever be of the slightest service to you I fear I
shall never have the opportunity.” Will spoke with fervor.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Dorothea, cordially. “It will come; and I shall
remember how well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be
friends when I first saw you—because of your relationship to Mr.
Casaubon.” There was a certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and
Will was conscious that his own were obeying a law of nature and
filling too. The allusion to Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if
anything at that moment could have spoiled the subduing power, the
sweet dignity, of her noble unsuspicious inexperience.</p>
<p>“And there is one thing even now that you can do,” said
Dorothea, rising and walking a little way under the strength of a
recurring impulse. “Promise me that you will not again, to any one,
speak of that subject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon’s writings—I mean
in that kind of way. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But
promise me.”</p>
<p>She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will,
looking gravely at him.</p>
<p>“Certainly, I will promise you,” said Will, reddening however.
If he never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left
off receiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to
hate him the more. The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and
Will was at least ready with that accomplishment. He said that he
must go now without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to
take leave of at the last moment. Dorothea gave him her hand, and
they exchanged a simple “Good-by.“</p>
<p>But going out of the porte cochere he met Mr. Casaubon, and that
gentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely
waived the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow,
which would be sufficiently crowded with the preparations for
departure.</p>
<p>“I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw,
which I think will heighten your opinion of him,” said Dorothea to
her husband in the coarse of the evening. She had mentioned
immediately on his entering that Will had just gone away, and would
come again, but Mr. Casaubon had said, “I met him outside, and we
made our final adieux, I believe,” saying this with the air and
tone by which we imply that any subject, whether private or public,
does not interest us enough to wish for a further remark upon it.
So Dorothea had waited.</p>
<p>“What is that, my love?” said Mr Casaubon (he always said “my
love“ when his manner was the coldest).</p>
<p>“He has made up his mind to leave off wandering at once, and to
give up his dependence on your generosity. He means soon to go back
to England, and work his own way. I thought you would consider that
a good sign,” said Dorothea, with an appealing look into her
husband’s neutral face.</p>
<p>“Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he
would addict himself?”</p>
<p>“No. But he said that he felt the danger which lay for him in
your generosity. Of course he will write to you about it. Do you
not think better of him for his resolve?”</p>
<p>“I shall await his communication on the subject,” said Mr.
Casaubon.</p>
<p>“I told him I was sure that the thing you considered in all you
did for him was his own welfare. I remembered your goodness in what
you said about him when I first saw him at Lowick,” said Dorothea,
putting her hand on her husband’s.</p>
<p>“I had a duty towards him,” said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other
hand on Dorothea’s in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but
with a glance which he could not hinder from being uneasy. “The
young man, I confess, is not otherwise an object of interest to me,
nor need we, I think, discuss his future course, which it is not
ours to determine beyond the limits which I have sufficiently
indicated.” Dorothea did not mention Will again.</p>
