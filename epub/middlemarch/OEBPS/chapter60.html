<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">A</span> few days afterwards—it was already the end of August—there was
an occasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the
public, if it chose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the
distinguished auspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture,
books, and pictures which anybody might see by the handbills to be
the best in every kind, belonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq. This was
not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade; on the
contrary, it was due to Mr. Larcher's great success in the carrying
business, which warranted his purchase of a mansion near Riverston
already furnished in high style by an illustrious Spa
physician—furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive
flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was nervous
until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural. Hence the
fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the
handbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the
history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be
sold without reserve, comprised a piece of carving by a
contemporary of Gibbons.</p>
<p>At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a
kind of festival. There was a table spread with the best cold
eatables, as at a superior funeral; and facilities were offered for
that generous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to
generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr.
Larcher’s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because
the house stood just at the end of the town, with a garden and
stables attached, in that pleasant issue from Middlemarch called
the London Road, which was also the road to the New Hospital and to
Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as the Shrubs. In short,
the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all classes with
leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in order simply
to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the races. The
second day, when the best furniture was to be sold, “everybody“ was
there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter’s, had looked in
for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and had rubbed
elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There was a wreath of
Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in
the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with desk
and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were
often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the
large bow-window opening on to the lawn.</p>
<p>“Everybody“ that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health
could not well endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had
particularly wished to have a certain picture—a ”Supper at Emmaus,“
attributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before
the day of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the
”Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of
Mr. Ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his
remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and
judge of the value of this particular painting—“if,“ added the
scrupulously polite banker, ”attendance at the sale would not
interfere with the arrangements for your departure, which I know is
imminent.“</p>
<p>This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear
if he had been in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to
an understanding entered into many weeks before with the
proprietors of the paper, that he should be at liberty any day he
pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he had
been training; since he wished finally to quit Middlemarch. But
indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing
what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable; and we all know the
difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it
may turn out to be unnecessary. In such states of mind the most
incredulous person has a private leaning towards miracle:
impossible to conceive how our wish could be fulfilled, still—very
wonderful things have happened! Will did not confess this weakness
to himself, but he lingered. What was the use of going to London at
that time of the year? The Rugby men who would remember him were
not there; and so far as political writing was concerned, he would
rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.“ At the present
moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he had
both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not
to go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he
had reasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be
happy to go to the sale.</p>
<p>Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung
with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a
fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low
designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property. Like
most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional
distinction, he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with
any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that
assertion—that there was anything in his blood, his bearing, or his
character to which he gave the mask of an opinion. When he was
under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for
days with a defiant look, the color changing in his transparent
skin as if he were on the qui vive, watching for something which he
had to dart upon.</p>
<p>This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale,
and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of
bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast. He was not
sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the
Middlemarch tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked
down on him as an adventurer, and were in a state of brutal
ignorance about Dante—who sneered at his Polish blood, and were
themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing. He stood in a
conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer, with a fore-finger
in each side-pocket and his head thrown backward, not caring to
speak to anybody, though he had been cordially welcomed as a
connoiss<i>ure</i> by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the utmost
activity of his great faculties.</p>
<p>And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit
their powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial
auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his
encyclopedic knowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might
object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles
from boot-jacks to “Berghems;“ but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a
kindly liquid in his veins; he was an admirer by nature, and would
have liked to have the universe under his hammer, feeling that it
would go at a higher figure for his recommendation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for
him. When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have
been forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the
auctioneer’s enthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable
principle of praising those things most which were most in need of
praise. The fender was of polished steel, with much lancet-shaped
open-work and a sharp edge.</p>
<p>“Now, ladies,” said he, “I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender
which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve,
being, as I may say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design,
a kind of thing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became
slightly nasal, trimming his outlines with his left finger—“that
might not fall in with ordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you that
by-and-by this style of workmanship will be the only one in
vogue—half-a-crown, you said? thank you—going at half-a-crown, this
characteristic fender; and I have particular information that the
antique style is very much sought after in high quarters. Three
shillings—three-and-sixpence—hold it well up, Joseph! Look, ladies,
at the chastity of the design—I have no doubt myself that it was
turned out in the last century! Four shillings, Mr. Mawmsey?—four
shillings.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a thing I would put in <i>my</i> drawing-room," said
Mrs. Mawmsey, audibly, for the warning of the rash husband. "I
wonder <i>at</i> Mrs. Larcher. Every blessed child's head that fell
against it would be cut in two. The edge is like a knife."</p>
<p>“Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most
uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you
have a leather shoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and
no knife at hand: many a man has been left hanging because there
was no knife to cut him down. Gentlemen, here’s a fender that if
you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no
time—with astonishing
celerity—four-and-sixpence—five—five-and-sixpence—an appropriate
thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest
a little out of his mind—six shillings—thank you, Mr. Clintup—going
at six shillings—going—gone!” The auctioneer’s glance, which had
been searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all
signs of bidding, here dropped on the paper before him, and his
voice too dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said,
“Mr. Clintup. Be handy, Joseph.”</p>
<p>“It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always
tell that joke on,” said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and
apologetically to his next neighbor. He was a diffident though
distinguished nurseryman, and feared that the audience might regard
his bid as a foolish one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. “Now,
ladies,“ said Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, ”this
tray contains a very recherchy lot—a collection of trifles for the
drawing-room table—and trifles make the sum <i>of</i> human
things—nothing more important than trifles—(yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes,
by-and-by)—but pass the tray round, Joseph—these bijoux must be
examined, ladies. This I have in my hand is an ingenious
contrivance—a sort of practical rebus, I may call it: here, you
see, it looks like an elegant heart-shaped box, portable—for the
pocket; there, again, it becomes like a splendid double flower—an
ornament for the table; and now"—Mr. Trumbull allowed the flower to
fall alarmingly into strings of heart-shaped leaves—"a book of
riddles! No less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red.
Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience, I should not wish you to
bid high for this lot—I have a longing for it myself. What can
promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more than a good
riddle?—it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to the
society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without
the elegant domino-box, card-basket, &amp;c., ought alone to give a
high price to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an
individual welcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?—four
shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et
caeteras. Here is a sample: 'How must you spell honey to make it
catch lady-birds? Answer—money.' You hear?—lady-birds—honey money.
This is an amusement to sharpen the intellect; it has a sting—it
has what we call satire, and wit without indecency.
Four-and-sixpence—five shillings."</p>
<p>The bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a
bidder, and this was too exasperating. Bowyer couldn’t afford it,
and only wanted to hinder every other man from making a figure. The
current carried even Mr. Horrock with it, but this committal of
himself to an opinion fell from him with so little sacrifice of his
neutral expression, that the bid might not have been detected as
his but for the friendly oaths of Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know
what Horrock would do with blasted stuff only fit for haberdashers
given over to that state of perdition which the horse-dealer so
cordially recognized in the majority of earthly existences. The lot
was finally knocked down at a guinea to Mr. Spilkins, a young
Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless with his pocket-money
and felt his want of memory for riddles.</p>
<p>“Come, Trumbull, this is too bad—you’ve been putting some old
maid’s rubbish into the sale,” murmured Mr. Toller, getting close
to the auctioneer. “I want to see how the prints go, and I must be
off soon.”</p>
<p>“<i>Im</i>mediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of
benevolence which your noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick
with the prints—Lot 235. Now, gentlemen, you who are
connoiss<i>ures</i>, you are going to have a treat. Here is an
engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his staff on the
Field of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which have, as
it were, enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be bold to
say—for a man in my line must not be blown about by political
winds—that a finer subject—of the modern order, belonging to our
own time and epoch—the understanding of man could hardly conceive:
angels might, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men."</p>
<p>“Who painted it?” said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.</p>
<p>“It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell—the painter is
not known,” answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his
last words, after which he pursed up his lips and stared round
him.</p>
<p>“I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved
emotion, as of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether
from awe or pity, nobody raised the price on him.</p>
<p>Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for,
and after he had secured them he went away. Other prints, and
afterwards some paintings, were sold to leading Middlemarchers who
had come with a special desire for them, and there was a more
active movement of the audience in and out; some, who had bought
what they wanted, going away, others coming in either quite newly
or from a temporary visit to the refreshments which were spread
under the marquee on the lawn. It was this marquee that Mr.
Bambridge was bent on buying, and he appeared to like looking
inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession. On the last
occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with him a
new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else, whose
appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a
relative of the horse-dealer’s—also “given to indulgence.” His
large whiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a
striking figure; but his suit of black, rather shabby at the edges,
caused the prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford
himself as much indulgence as he liked.</p>
<p>“Who is it you’ve picked up, Bam?” said Mr. Horrock, aside.</p>
<p>“Ask him yourself,” returned Mr. Bambridge. “He said he’d just
turned in from the road.”</p>
<p>Mr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his
stick with one hand, using his toothpick with the other, and
looking about him with a certain restlessness apparently under the
silence imposed on him by circumstances.</p>
<p>At length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Wills
immense relief, for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that
he had drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall
just behind the auctioneer. He now came forward again, and his eye
caught the conspicuous stranger, who, rather to his surprise, was
staring at him markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to by
Mr. Trumbull.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a
connoiss<i>ure</i>, I think. It is some pleasure," the auctioneer
went on with a rising fervor, "to have a picture like this to show
to a company of ladies and gentlemen—a picture worth any sum to an
individual whose means were on a level with his judgment. It is a
painting of the Italian school—by the celebrated Guydo, the
greatest painter in the world, the chief of the Old Masters, as
they are called—I take it, because they were up to a thing or two
beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of
mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a great many
pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this
mark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family
subjects. But here is a Guydo—the frame alone is worth pounds—which
any lady might be proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we
call a refectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of
the Corporation wished to show his munifi<i>cence</i>. Turn it a
little, sir? yes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr.
Ladislaw, having been abroad, understands the merit of these
things, you observe."</p>
<p>All eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said,
coolly, “Five pounds.” The auctioneer burst out in deep
remonstrance.</p>
<p>“Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and
gentlemen, for the credit of the town! Suppose it should be
discovered hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this
town, and nobody in Middlemarch awake to it. Five guineas—five
seven-six—five ten. Still, ladies, still! It is a gem, and ’Full
many a gem,’ as the poet says, has been allowed to go at a nominal
price because the public knew no better, because it was offered in
circles where there was—I was going to say a low feeling, but
no!—Six pounds—six guineas—a Guydo of the first order going at six
guineas—it is an insult to religion, ladies; it touches us all as
Christians, gentlemen, that a subject like this should go at such a
low figure—six pounds ten—seven—”</p>
<p>The bidding was brisk, and Will continued to share in it,
remembering that Mrs. Bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture,
and thinking that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds. But
it was knocked down to him at ten guineas, whereupon he pushed his
way towards the bow-window and went out. He chose to go under the
marquee to get a glass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was
empty of other visitors, and he asked the woman in attendance to
fetch him some fresh water; but before she was well gone he was
annoyed to see entering the florid stranger who had stared at him.
It struck Will at this moment that the man might be one of those
political parasitic insects of the bloated kind who had once or
twice claimed acquaintance with him as having heard him speak on
the Reform question, and who might think of getting a shilling by
news. In this light his person, already rather heating to behold on
a summer’s day, appeared the more disagreeable; and Will,
half-seated on the elbow of a garden-chair, turned his eyes
carefully away from the comer. But this signified little to our
acquaintance Mr. Raffles, who never hesitated to thrust himself on
unwilling observation, if it suited his purpose to do so. He moved
a step or two till he was in front of Will, and said with
full-mouthed haste, “Excuse me, Mr. Ladislaw—was your mother’s name
Sarah Dunkirk?”</p>
<p>Will, starting to his feet, moved backward a step, frowning, and
saying with some fierceness, “Yes, sir, it was. And what is that to
you?”</p>
<p>It was in Will’s nature that the first spark it threw out was a
direct answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences.
To have said, “What is that to you?” in the first instance, would
have seemed like shuffling—as if he minded who knew anything about
his origin!</p>
<p>Raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision
which was implied in Ladislaw’s threatening air. The slim young
fellow with his girl’s complexion looked like a tiger-cat ready to
spring on him. Under such circumstances Mr. Raffles’s pleasure in
annoying his company was kept in abeyance.</p>
<p>“No offence, my good sir, no offence! I only remember your
mother—knew her when she was a girl. But it is your father that you
feature, sir. I had the pleasure of seeing your father too. Parents
alive, Mr. Ladislaw?”</p>
<p>“No!“ thundered Will, in the same attitude as before.</p>
<p>“Should be glad to do you a service, Mr. Ladislaw—by Jove, I
should! Hope to meet again.”</p>
<p>Hereupon Raffles, who had lifted his hat with the last words,
turned himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away. Will
looked after him a moment, and could see that he did not re-enter
the auction-room, but appeared to be walking towards the road. For
an instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man
go on talking;—but no! on the whole he preferred doing without
knowledge from that source.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, however, Raffles overtook him in the
street, and appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his
former reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving
familiarity, greeted him jovially and walked by his side, remarking
at first on the pleasantness of the town and neighborhood. Will
suspected that the man had been drinking and was considering how to
shake him off when Raffles said—</p>
<p>“I’ve been abroad myself, Mr. Ladislaw—I’ve seen the world—used
to parley-vous a little. It was at Boulogne I saw your father—a
most uncommon likeness you are of him, by Jove!
mouth—nose—eyes—hair turned off your brow just like his—a little in
the foreign style. John Bull doesn’t do much of that. But your
father was very ill when I saw him. Lord, lord! hands you might see
through. You were a small youngster then. Did he get well?”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Will, curtly.</p>
<p>“Ah! Well! I’ve often wondered what became of your mother. She
ran away from her friends when she was a young lass—a
proud-spirited lass, and pretty, by Jove! I knew the reason why she
ran away,” said Raffles, winking slowly as he looked sideways at
Will.</p>
<p>“You know nothing dishonorable of her, sir,” said Will, turning
on him rather savagely. But Mr. Raffles just now was not sensitive
to shades of manner.</p>
<p>“Not a bit!” said he, tossing his head decisively “She was a
little too honorable to like her friends—that was it!” Here Raffles
again winked slowly. “Lord bless you, I knew all about ’em—a little
in what you may call the respectable thieving line—the high style
of receiving-house—none of your holes and corners—first-rate.
Slap-up shop, high profits and no mistake. But Lord! Sarah would
have known nothing about it—a dashing young lady she was—fine
boarding-school—fit for a lord’s wife—only Archie Duncan threw it
at her out of spite, because she would have nothing to do with him.
And so she ran away from the whole concern. I travelled for ’em,
sir, in a gentlemanly way—at a high salary. They didn’t mind her
running away at first—godly folks, sir, very godly—and she was for
the stage. The son was alive then, and the daughter was at a
discount. Hallo! here we are at the Blue Bull. What do you say, Mr.
Ladislaw?—shall we turn in and have a glass?”</p>
<p>“No, I must say good evening,” said Will, dashing up a passage
which led into Lowick Gate, and almost running to get out of
Raffles’s reach.</p>
<p>He walked a long while on the Lowick road away from the town,
glad of the starlit darkness when it came. He felt as if he had had
dirt cast on him amidst shouts of scorn. There was this to confirm
the fellow’s statement—that his mother never would tell him the
reason why she had run away from her family.</p>
<p>Well! what was he, Will Ladislaw, the worse, supposing the truth
about that family to be the ugliest? His mother had braved hardship
in order to separate herself from it. But if Dorothea’s friends had
known this story—if the Chettams had known it—they would have had a
fine color to give their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking
him unfit to come near her. However, let them suspect what they
pleased, they would find themselves in the wrong. They would find
out that the blood in his veins was as free from the taint of
meanness as theirs.</p>
