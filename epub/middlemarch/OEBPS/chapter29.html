<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">O</span>ne morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick,
Dorothea—but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only
possible one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all
our interest, all our effort at understanding being given to the
young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too
will get faded, and will know the older and more eating griefs
which we are helping to neglect. In spite of the blinking eyes and
white moles objectionable to Celia, and the want of muscular curve
which was morally painful to Sir James, Mr. Casaubon had an intense
consciousness within him, and was spiritually a-hungered like the
rest of us. He had done nothing exceptional in marrying—nothing but
what society sanctions, and considers an occasion for wreaths and
bouquets. It had occurred to him that he must not any longer defer
his intention of matrimony, and he had reflected that in taking a
wife, a man of good position should expect and carefully choose a
blooming young lady—the younger the better, because more educable
and submissive—of a rank equal to his own, of religious principles,
virtuous disposition, and good understanding. On such a young lady
he would make handsome settlements, and he would neglect no
arrangement for her happiness: in return, he should receive family
pleasures and leave behind him that copy of himself which seemed so
urgently required of a man—to the sonneteers of the sixteenth
century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer had
insisted on Mr. Casaubon's leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he
had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key;
but he had always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the
sense that he was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world
was getting dimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for
losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before they too
were left behind by the years.</p>
<p>And when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even
more than he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him
as would enable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid
which Mr. Casaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious
dread of. (Mr. Casaubon was nervously conscious that he was
expected to manifest a powerful mind.) Providence, in its kindness,
had supplied him with the wife he needed. A wife, a modest young
lady, with the purely appreciative, unambitious abilities of her
sex, is sure to think her husband’s mind powerful. Whether
Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke in presenting her
with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could hardly occur to him.
Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think
as much about his own qualifications for making a charming girl
happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy. As if a man
could choose not only his wife hut his wife’s husband! Or as if he
were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own person!—
When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only natural;
and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to
begin.</p>
<p>He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life.
To know intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an
enthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily
frame, and his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it
was too languid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate
delight; it went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was
hatched, thinking of its wings and never flying. His experience was
of that pitiable kind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of
all that it should be known: it was that proud narrow sensitiveness
which has not mass enough to spare for transformation into
sympathy, and quivers thread-like in small currents of
self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic scrupulosity. And Mr.
Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a severe
self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor according
to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized opinion.
In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of
making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead
upon his mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga“ as he called them—by
which he tested his public and deposited small monumental records
of his march, were far from having been seen in all their
significance. He suspected the Archdeacon of not having read them;
he was in painful doubt as to what was really thought of them by
the leading minds of Brasenose, and bitterly convinced that his old
acquaintance Carp had been the writer of that depreciatory
recension which was kept locked in a small drawer of Mr. Casaubon’s
desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory. These were
heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that melancholy
embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive claim: even
his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his own
authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in
immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still
unwritten Key to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for
him. It is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught
and yet not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life
and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self—never
to be fully possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our
consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a
thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy of an action, but
always to be scholarly and uninspired, ambitious and timid,
scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a dean or even a bishop would
make little difference, I fear, to Mr. Casaubon’s uneasiness.
Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that behind the big mask
and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our poor little eyes
peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less under anxious
control.</p>
<p>To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before,
to sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of
annexing happiness with a lovely young bride; but even before
marriage, as we have seen, he found himself under a new depression
in the consciousness that the new bliss was not blissful to him.
Inclination yearned back to its old, easier custom. And the deeper
he went in domesticity the more did the sense of acquitting himself
and acting with propriety predominate over any other satisfaction.
Marriage, like religion and erudition, nay, like authorship itself,
was fated to become an outward requirement, and Edward Casaubon was
bent on fulfilling unimpeachably all requirements. Even drawing
Dorothea into use in his study, according to his own intention
before marriage, was an effort which he was always tempted to
defer, and but for her pleading insistence it might never have
begun. But she had succeeded in making it a matter of course that
she should take her place at an early hour in the library and have
work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her. The work had
been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate
intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on
some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries
whereby certain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected.
References were extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless;
and sentences were actually to be written in the shape wherein they
would be scanned by Brasenose and a less formidable posterity.
These minor monumental productions were always exciting to Mr.
Casaubon; digestion was made difficult by the interference of
citations, or by the rivalry of dialectical phrases ringing against
each other in his brain. And from the first there was to be a Latin
dedication about which everything was uncertain except that it was
not to be addressed to Carp: it was a poisonous regret to Mr.
Casaubon that he had once addressed a dedication to Carp in which
he had numbered that member of the animal kingdom among the viros
nullo aevo perituros, a mistake which would infallibly lay the
dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and might even be
chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I
began to say a little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the
library where he had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a
second visit to Lowick, probably the last before her marriage, and
was in the drawing-room expecting Sir James.</p>
<p>Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood,
and she saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the
last hour. She was going silently to her desk when he said, in that
distant tone which implied that he was discharging a disagreeable
duty—</p>
<p>“Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one
addressed to me.”</p>
<p>It was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the
signature.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ladislaw! What can he have to say to me?” she exclaimed, in
a tone of pleased surprise. “But,“ she added, looking at Mr.
Casaubon, ”I can imagine what he has written to you about.“</p>
<p>“You can, if you please, read the letter,” said Mr. Casaubon,
severely pointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her. “But
I may as well say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it
contains to pay a visit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring
an interval of complete freedom from such distractions as have been
hitherto inevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory
vivacity makes their presence a fatigue.”</p>
<p>There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her
husband since that little explosion in Rome, which had left such
strong traces in her mind that it had been easier ever since to
quell emotion than to incur the consequence of venting it. But this
ill-tempered anticipation that she could desire visits which might
be disagreeable to her husband, this gratuitous defence of himself
against selfish complaint on her part, was too sharp a sting to be
meditated on until after it had been resented. Dorothea had thought
that she could have been patient with John Milton, but she had
never imagined him behaving in this way; and for a moment Mr.
Casaubon seemed to be stupidly undiscerning and odiously unjust.
Pity, that “new-born babe” which was by-and-by to rule many a storm
within her, did not “stride the blast” on this occasion. With her
first words, uttered in a tone that shook him, she startled Mr.
Casaubon into looking at her, and meeting the flash of her
eyes.</p>
<p>“Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy
you? You speak to me as if I were something you had to contend
against. Wait at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure
apart from yours.”</p>
<p>“Dorothea, you are hasty,” answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.</p>
<p>Decidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable
level of wifehood—unless she had been pale and feature less and
taken everything for granted.</p>
<p>“I think it was you who were first hasty in your false
suppositions about my feeling,” said Dorothea, in the same tone.
The fire was not dissipated yet, and she thought it was ignoble in
her husband not to apologize to her.</p>
<p>“We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea.
I have neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.”</p>
<p>Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return
to his writing, though his hand trembled so much that the words
seemed to be written in an unknown character. There are answers
which, in turning away wrath, only send it to the other end of the
room, and to have a discussion coolly waived when you feel that
justice is all on your own side is even more exasperating in
marriage than in philosophy.</p>
<p>Dorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s
writing-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation
within her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl
away any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean
cupidity. She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her
husband’s bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they
had caused him to offend her. She began to work at once, and her
hand did not tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the
quotations which had been given to her the day before, she felt
that she was forming her letters beautifully, and it seemed to her
that she saw the construction of the Latin she was copying, and
which she was beginning to understand, more clearly than usual. In
her indignation there was a sense of superiority, but it went out
for the present in firmness of stroke, and did not compress itself
into an inward articulate voice pronouncing the once “affable
archangel“ a poor creature.</p>
<p>There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and
Dorothea had not looked away from her own table, when she heard the
loud bang of a book on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr.
Casaubon on the library steps clinging forward as if he were in
some bodily distress. She started up and bounded towards him in an
instant: he was evidently in great straits for breath. Jumping on a
stool she got close to his elbow and said with her whole soul
melted into tender alarm—</p>
<p>“Can you lean on me, dear?”</p>
<p>He was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to
her, unable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he
descended the three steps and fell backward in the large chair
which Dorothea had drawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no
longer gasped but seemed helpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang
the bell violently, and presently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the
couch: he did not faint, and was gradually reviving, when Sir James
Chettam came in, having been met in the hall with the news that Mr.
Casaubon had “had a fit in the library.”</p>
<p>“Good God! this is just what might have been expected,” was his
immediate thought. If his prophetic soul had been urged to
particularize, it seemed to him that “fits“ would have been the
definite expression alighted upon. He asked his informant, the
butler, whether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew
his master want the doctor before; but would it not be right to
send for a physician?</p>
<p>When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could
make some signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the
reaction from her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his
side now rose and herself proposed that some one should ride off
for a medical man.</p>
<p>“I recommend you to send for Lydgate,” said Sir James. “My
mother has called him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever.
She has had a poor opinion of the physicians since my father’s
death.”</p>
<p>Dorothea appealed to her husband, and he made a silent sign of
approval. So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon,
for the messenger, who was Sir James Chettam’s man and knew Mr.
Lydgate, met him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving
his arm to Miss Vincy.</p>
<p>Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble
till Sir James told her of it. After Dorothea’s account, he no
longer considered the illness a fit, but still something “of that
nature.”</p>
<p>“Poor dear Dodo—how dreadful!” said Celia, feeling as much
grieved as her own perfect happiness would allow. Her little hands
were clasped, and enclosed by Sir James’s as a bud is enfolded by a
liberal calyx. “It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be
ill; but I never did like him. And I think he is not half fond
enough of Dorothea; and he ought to be, for I am sure no one else
would have had him—do you think they would?”</p>
<p>“I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,” said
Sir James.</p>
<p>“Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I
think she never will.”</p>
<p>“She is a noble creature,” said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He
had just had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen
Dorothea stretching her tender arm under her husband’s neck and
looking at him with unspeakable sorrow. He did not know how much
penitence there was in the sorrow.</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to
say so, but <i>he</i> would not have been comfortable with Dodo.
"Shall I go to her? Could I help her, do you think?"</p>
<p>“I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before
Lydgate comes,” said Sir James, magnanimously. “Only don’t stay
long.”</p>
<p>While Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he
had originally felt about Dorothea’s engagement, and feeling a
revival of his disgust at Mr. Brooke’s indifference. If
Cadwallader—if every one else had regarded the affair as he, Sir
James, had done, the marriage might have been hindered. It was
wicked to let a young girl blindly decide her fate in that way,
without any effort to save her. Sir James had long ceased to have
any regrets on his own account: his heart was satisfied with his
engagement to Celia. But he had a chivalrous nature (was not the
disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of old
chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its
death had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a
consecrating effect to Dorothea. He could remain her brotherly
friend, interpreting her actions with generous trustfulness.</p>
