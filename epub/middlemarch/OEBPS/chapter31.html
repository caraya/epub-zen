<blockquote><p>
        How will you know the pitch of that great bell
        Too large for you to stir?  Let but a flute
        Play ’neath the fine-mixed metal listen close
        Till the right note flows forth, a silvery rill.
        Then shall the huge bell tremble—then the mass
        With myriad waves concurrent shall respond
        In low soft unison.

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">L</span>ydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and
laid some emphasis on the strong feeling she appeared to have for
that formal studious man thirty years older than herself.</p>
<p>“Of course she is devoted to her husband,” said Rosamond,
implying a notion of necessary sequence which the scientific man
regarded as the prettiest possible for a woman; but she was
thinking at the same time that it was not so very melancholy to be
mistress of Lowick Manor with a husband likely to die soon. “Do you
think her very handsome?”</p>
<p>“She certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it,”
said Lydgate.</p>
<p>“I suppose it would be unprofessional,” said Rosamond, dimpling.
“But how your practice is spreading! You were called in before to
the Chettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons.”</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission. ”But I
don’t really like attending such people so well as the poor. The
cases are more monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and
listen more deferentially to nonsense.“</p>
<p>“Not more than in Middlemarch,” said Rosamond. “And at least you
go through wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves
everywhere.”</p>
<p>“That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci,” said Lydgate, just
bending his head to the table and lifting with his fourth finger
her delicate handkerchief which lay at the mouth of her reticule,
as if to enjoy its scent, while he looked at her with a smile.</p>
<p>But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered
about the flower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely.
It was not more possible to find social isolation in that town than
elsewhere, and two people persistently flirting could by no means
escape from “the various entanglements, weights, blows, clashings,
motions, by which things severally go on.” Whatever Miss Vincy did
must be remarked, and she was perhaps the more conspicuous to
admirers and critics because just now Mrs. Vincy, after some
struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little while at Stone Court,
there being no other way of at once gratifying old Featherstone and
keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a less tolerable
daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred’s illness disappeared.</p>
<p>Aunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick
Gate to see Rosamond, now she was alone. For Mrs. Bulstrode had a
true sisterly feeling for her brother; always thinking that he
might have married better, but wishing well to the children. Now
Mrs. Bulstrode had a long-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale.
They had nearly the same preferences in silks, patterns for
underclothing, china-ware, and clergymen; they confided their
little troubles of health and household management to each other,
and various little points of superiority on Mrs. Bulstrode’s side,
namely, more decided seriousness, more admiration for mind, and a
house outside the town, sometimes served to give color to their
conversation without dividing them—well-meaning women both, knowing
very little of their own motives.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale,
happened to say that she could not stay longer, because she was
going to see poor Rosamond.</p>
<p>“Why do you say ’poor Rosamond’?” said Mrs. Plymdale, a
round-eyed sharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.</p>
<p>“She is so pretty, and has been brought up in such
thoughtlessness. The mother, you know, had always that levity about
her, which makes me anxious for the children.”</p>
<p>“Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind,” said Mrs. Plymdale,
with emphasis, “I must say, anybody would suppose you and Mr.
Bulstrode would be delighted with what has happened, for you have
done everything to put Mr. Lydgate forward.”</p>
<p>“Selina, what do you mean?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in genuine
surprise.</p>
<p>“Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned’s sake,” said Mrs.
Plymdale. “He could certainly better afford to keep such a wife
than some people can; but I should wish him to look elsewhere.
Still a mother has anxieties, and some young men would take to a
bad life in consequence. Besides, if I was obliged to speak, I
should say I was not fond of strangers coming into a town.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Selina,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, with a little
emphasis in her turn. “Mr. Bulstrode was a stranger here at one
time. Abraham and Moses were strangers in the land, and we are told
to entertain strangers. And especially,” she added, after a slight
pause, “when they are unexceptionable.”</p>
<p>“I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a
mother.”</p>
<p>“Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against
a niece of mine marrying your son.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy—I am sure it is nothing else,”
said Mrs. Plymdale, who had never before given all her confidence
to “Harriet“ on this subject. ”No young man in Middlemarch was good
enough for her: I have heard her mother say as much. That is not a
Christian spirit, I think. But now, from all I hear, she has found
a man as proud as herself.“</p>
<p>“You don’t mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.
Lydgate?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out her
own ignorance.</p>
<p>“Is it possible you don’t know, Harriet?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really
never hear any. You see so many people that I don’t see. Your
circle is rather different from ours.”</p>
<p>“Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode’s great favorite—and
yours too, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant
him for Kate, when she is a little older.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe there can be anything serious at present,” said
Mrs. Bulstrode. “My brother would certainly have told me.”</p>
<p>“Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody
can see Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking them to
be engaged. However, it is not my business. Shall I put up the
pattern of mittens?”</p>
<p>After this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her niece with a mind newly
weighted. She was herself handsomely dressed, but she noticed with
a little more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in
and met her in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped.
Mrs. Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother, and
had none of her husband’s low-toned pallor. She had a good honest
glance and used no circumlocution.</p>
<p>“You are alone, I see, my dear,” she said, as they entered the
drawing-room together, looking round gravely. Rosamond felt sure
that her aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down
near each other. Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond’s
bonnet was so charming that it was impossible not to desire the
same kind of thing for Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes, which were
rather fine, rolled round that ample quilled circuit, while she
spoke.</p>
<p>“I have just heard something about you that has surprised me
very much, Rosamond.”</p>
<p>“What is that, aunt?” Rosamond’s eyes also were roaming over her
aunt’s large embroidered collar.</p>
<p>“I can hardly believe it—that you should be engaged without my
knowing it—without your father’s telling me.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode’s
eyes finally rested on Rosamond’s, who blushed deeply, and
said—</p>
<p>“I am not engaged, aunt.”</p>
<p>“How is it that every one says so, then—that it is the town’s
talk?”</p>
<p>“The town’s talk is of very little consequence, I think,” said
Rosamond, inwardly gratified.</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don’t despise your neighbors
so. Remember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no
fortune: your father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you
anything. Mr. Lydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there
is an attraction in that. I like talking to such men myself; and
your uncle finds him very useful. But the profession is a poor one
here. To be sure, this life is not everything; but it is seldom a
medical man has true religious views—there is too much pride of
intellect. And you are not fit to marry a poor man.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt. He has very high
connections.”</p>
<p>“He told me himself he was poor.”</p>
<p>“That is because he is used to people who have a high style</p>
<p>“My dear Rosamond, <i>you</i> must not think of living in high
style."</p>
<p>Rosamond looked down and played with her reticule. She was not a
fiery young lady and had no sharp answers, but she meant to live as
she pleased.</p>
<p>“Then it is really true?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very
earnestly at her niece. “You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate—there is
some understanding between you, though your father doesn’t know. Be
open, my dear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an
offer?”</p>
<p>Poor Rosamond’s feelings were very unpleasant. She had been
quite easy as to Lydgate’s feeling and intention, but now when her
aunt put this question she did not like being unable to say Yes.
Her pride was hurt, but her habitual control of manner helped
her.</p>
<p>“Pray excuse me, aunt. I would rather not speak on the
subject.”</p>
<p>“You would not give your heart to a man without a decided
prospect, I trust, my dear. And think of the two excellent offers I
know of that you have refused!—and one still within your reach, if
you will not throw it away. I knew a very great beauty who married
badly at last, by doing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young
man—some might think good-looking; and an only son; and a large
business of that kind is better than a profession. Not that
marrying is everything. I would have you seek first the kingdom of
God. But a girl should keep her heart within her own power.”</p>
<p>“I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have
already refused him. If I loved, I should love at once and without
change,” said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic
heroine, and playing the part prettily.</p>
<p>“I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy
voice, rising to go. “You have allowed your affections to be
engaged without return.”</p>
<p>“No, indeed, aunt,” said Rosamond, with emphasis.</p>
<p>“Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious
attachment to you?”</p>
<p>Rosamond’s cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and
she felt much mortification. She chose to be silent, and her aunt
went away all the more convinced.</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to
do what his wife bade him, and she now, without telling her
reasons, desired him on the next opportunity to find out in
conversation with Mr. Lydgate whether he had any intention of
marrying soon. The result was a decided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on
being cross-questioned, showed that Lydgate had spoken as no man
would who had any attachment that could issue in matrimony. Mrs.
Bulstrode now felt that she had a serious duty before her, and she
soon managed to arrange a tete-a-tete with Lydgate, in which she
passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy’s health, and expressions of
her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large family, to general
remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with regard to
their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and
disappointing, making little return for the money spent on them,
and a girl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere
with her prospects.</p>
<p>“Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see
much company,” said Mrs. Bulstrode “Gentlemen pay her attention,
and engross her all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the
moment, and that drives off others. I think it is a heavy
responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any
girl.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an
unmistakable purpose of warning, if not of rebuke.</p>
<p>“Clearly,“ said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a
little in return. ”On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb
to go about with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young
lady lest she should fall in love with him, or lest others should
think she must.“</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You
know that our young men here cannot cope with you. Where you
frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl’s making
a desirable settlement in life, and prevent her from accepting
offers even if they are made.”</p>
<p>Lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the Middlemarch
Orlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode’s
meaning. She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was
necessary to do, and that in using the superior word “militate“ she
had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were
still evident enough.</p>
<p>Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand,
felt curiously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then
stooped to beckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to
decline his hollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go
away, because he had been dining with other guests, and had just
taken tea. But Mrs. Bulstrode, having no doubt that she had been
understood, turned the conversation.</p>
<p>Solomon’s Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the
sore palate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth
innuendoes. The next day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in
the street, supposed that they should meet at Vincy’s in the
evening. Lydgate answered curtly, no—he had work to do—he must give
up going out in the evening.</p>
<p>“What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are
stopping your ears?” said the Vicar. “Well, if you don’t mean to be
won by the sirens, you are right to take precautions in time.”</p>
<p>A few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these
words as anything more than the Vicar’s usual way of putting
things. They seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the
impression that he had been making a fool of himself and behaving
so as to be misunderstood: not, he believed, by Rosamond herself;
she, he felt sure, took everything as lightly as he intended it.
She had an exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of
manners; but the people she lived among were blunderers and
busybodies. However, the mistake should go no farther. He
resolved—and kept his resolution—that he would not go to Mr.
Vincy’s except on business.</p>
<p>Rosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by
her aunt’s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that
she had not seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that
might possibly come—into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge
which so cheaply wipes out the hopes of mortals. The world would
have a new dreariness for her, as a wilderness that a magician’s
spells had turned for a little while into a garden. She felt that
she was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love, and that
no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial
building as she had been enjoying for the last six months. Poor
Rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as Ariadne—as a
charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her boxes full of
costumes and no hope of a coach.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all
alike called love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which
is an apology for everything (in literature and the drama). Happily
Rosamond did not think of committing any desperate act: she plaited
her fair hair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly
calm. Her most cheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had
interfered in some way to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was
better than a spontaneous indifference in him. Any one who imagines
ten days too short a time—not for falling into leanness, lightness,
or other measurable effects of passion, but—for the whole spiritual
circuit of alarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of
what can go on in the elegant leisure of a young lady’s mind.</p>
<p>On the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court
was requested by Mrs. Vincy to let her husband know that there was
a marked change in Mr. Featherstone’s health, and that she wished
him to come to Stone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have
called at the warehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf
of his pocket-book and left it at the door. Yet these simple
devices apparently did not occur to him, from which we may conclude
that he had no strong objection to calling at the house at an hour
when Mr. Vincy was not at home, and leaving the message with Miss
Vincy. A man may, from various motives, decline to give his
company, but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody
missed him. It would be a graceful, easy way of piecing on the new
habits to the old, to have a few playful words with Rosamond about
his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve to take long
fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also, that
momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.
Bulstrode’s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging
hairs into the more substantial web of his thoughts.</p>
<p>Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in
that he felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any
playfulness, he began at once to speak of his reason for calling,
and to beg her, almost formally, to deliver the message to her
father. Rosamond, who at the first moment felt as if her happiness
were returning, was keenly hurt by Lydgate’s manner; her blush had
departed, and she assented coldly, without adding an unnecessary
word, some trivial chain-work which she had in her hands enabling
her to avoid looking at Lydgate higher than his chin. In all
failures, the beginning is certainly the half of the whole. After
sitting two long moments while he moved his whip and could say
nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made nervous by her
struggle between mortification and the wish not to betray it,
dropped her chain as if startled, and rose too, mechanically.
Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain. When he rose
he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair long neck
which he had been used to see turning about under the most perfect
management of self-contented grace. But as he raised his eyes now
he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly,
and made him look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this
moment she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five
years old: she felt that her tears had risen, and it was no use to
try to do anything else than let them stay like water on a blue
flower or let them fall over her cheeks, even as they would.</p>
<p>That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch:
it shook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who
was looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very
warm-hearted and rash. He did not know where the chain went; an
idea had thrilled through the recesses within him which had a
miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying
buried there in no sealed sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily
pierced mould. His words were quite abrupt and awkward; but the
tone made them sound like an ardent, appealing avowal.</p>
<p>“What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.”</p>
<p>Rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not
sure that she knew what the words were: but she looked at Lydgate
and the tears fell over her cheeks. There could have been no more
complete answer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting
everything else, completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness
at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him
for her joy, actually put his arms round her, folding her gently
and protectingly—he was used to being gentle with the weak and
suffering—and kissed each of the two large tears. This was a
strange way of arriving at an understanding, but it was a short
way. Rosamond was not angry, but she moved backward a little in
timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and speak less
incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession, and he
poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive
lavishment. In half an hour he left the house an engaged man, whose
soul was not his own, but the woman’s to whom he had bound
himself.</p>
<p>He came again in the evening to speak with Mr. Vincy, who, just
returned from Stone Court, was feeling sure that it would not be
long before he heard of Mr. Featherstone’s demise. The felicitous
word “demise,“ which had seasonably occurred to him, had raised his
spirits even above their usual evening pitch. The right word is
always a power, and communicates its definiteness to our action.
Considered as a demise, old Featherstone’s death assumed a merely
legal aspect, so that Mr. Vincy could tap his snuff-box over it and
be jovial, without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity;
and Mr. Vincy hated both solemnity and affectation. Who was ever
awe struck about a testator, or sang a hymn on the title to real
property? Mr. Vincy was inclined to take a jovial view of all
things that evening: he even observed to Lydgate that Fred had got
the family constitution after all, and would soon be as fine a
fellow as ever again; and when his approbation of Rosamond’s
engagement was asked for, he gave it with astonishing facility,
passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of
matrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from
the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch.</p>
