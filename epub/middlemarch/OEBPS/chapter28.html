  <span class="speaker">1st Gent.</span>  All times are good to seek your wedded home <br/>
                       Bringing a mutual delight.

    <span class="speaker">2d Gent.</span>
    Why, true. <br/>
                       The calendar hath not an evil day<br/>
                       For souls made one by love, and even death<br/>
                       Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves<br/>
                       While they two clasped each other, and foresaw<br/>
                       No life apart.

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">Mr.</span> and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey,
arrived at Lowick Manor in the middle of January. A light snow was
falling as they descended at the door, and in the morning, when
Dorothea passed from her dressing-room avenue the blue-green
boudoir that we know of, she saw the long avenue of limes lifting
their trunks from a white earth, and spreading white branches
against the dun and motionless sky. The distant flat shrank in
uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity of cloud. The very
furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since she saw it
before: the slag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his
ghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the
bookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books. The bright
fire of dry oak-boughs burning on the dogs seemed an incongruous
renewal of life and glow—like the figure of Dorothea herself as she
entered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for
Celia.</p>
<p>She was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth
can glow: there was gem-like brightness on her coiled hair and in
her hazel eyes; there was warm red life in her lips; her throat had
a breathing whiteness above the differing white of the fur which
itself seemed to wind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray
pelisse with a tenderness gathered from her own, a sentient
commingled innocence which kept its loveliness against the
crystalline purity of the outdoor snow. As she laid the cameo-cases
on the table in the bow-window, she unconsciously kept her hands on
them, immediately absorbed in looking out on the still, white
enclosure which made her visible world.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation,
was in the library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker.
By-and-by Celia would come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as
sister, and through the next weeks there would be wedding visits
received and given; all in continuance of that transitional life
understood to correspond with the excitement of bridal felicity,
and keeping up the sense of busy ineffectiveness, as of a dream
which the dreamer begins to suspect. The duties of her married
life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed to be shrinking
with the furniture and the white vapor-walled landscape. The clear
heights where she expected to walk in full communion had become
difficult to see even in her imagination; the delicious repose of
the soul on a complete superior had been shaken into uneasy effort
and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the days begin of
that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her husband’s
life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had preconceived
them; but somehow—still somehow. In this solemnly pledged union of
her life, duty would present itself in some new form of inspiration
and give a new meaning to wifely love.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor—there
was the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman’s world, where
everything was done for her and none asked for her aid—where the
sense of connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be
kept up painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from
without in claims that would have shaped her energies.— “What shall
I do?” “Whatever you please, my dear:” that had been her brief
history since she had left off learning morning lessons and
practising silly rhythms on the hated piano. Marriage, which was to
bring guidance into worthy and imperative occupation, had not yet
freed her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive liberty: it had not
even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of unchecked
tenderness. Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a moral
imprisonment which made itself one with the chill, colorless,
narrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read
books, and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed
to be vanishing from the daylight.</p>
<p>In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing
but the dreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and
turning away from the window she walked round the room. The ideas
and hopes which were living in her mind when she first saw this
room nearly three months before were present now only as memories:
she judged them as we judge transient and departed things. All
existence seemed to beat with a lower pulse than her own, and her
religious faith was a solitary cry, the struggle out of a nightmare
in which every object was withering and shrinking away from her.
Each remembered thing in the room was disenchanted, was deadened as
an unlit transparency, till her wandering gaze came to the group of
miniatures, and there at last she saw something which had gathered
new breath and meaning: it was the miniature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt
Julia, who had made the unfortunate marriage—of Will Ladislaw’s
grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that it was alive now—the
delicate woman’s face which yet had a headstrong look, a
peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her friends who
thought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to
be a mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the
merciful silence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea
seemed to have passed over since she first looked at this
miniature! She felt a new companionship with it, as if it had an
ear for her and could see how she was looking at it. Here was a
woman who had known some difficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors
deepened, the lips and chin seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes
seemed to be sending out light, the face was masculine and beamed
on her with that full gaze which tells her on whom it falls that
she is too interesting for the slightest movement of her eyelid to
pass unnoticed and uninterpreted. The vivid presentation came like
a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt herself smiling, and turning
from the miniature sat down and looked up as if she were again
talking to a figure in front of her. But the smile disappeared as
she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—</p>
<p>“Oh, it was cruel to speak so! How sad—how dreadful!”</p>
<p>She rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the
corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband
and inquire if she could do anything for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker
was gone and Mr. Casaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if
all her morning’s gloom would vanish if she could see her husband
glad because of her presence.</p>
<p>But when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia
coming up, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and
congratulations with Mr. Casaubon.</p>
<p>“Dodo!“ said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her
sister, whose arms encircled her, and said no more. I think they
both cried a little in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran
down-stairs to greet her uncle.</p>
<p>“I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after
kissing her forehead. “Rome has agreed with you, I see—happiness,
frescos, the antique—that sort of thing. Well, it’s very pleasant
to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?
But Casaubon is a little pale, I tell him—a little pale, you know.
Studying hard in his holidays is carrying it rather too far. I
overdid it at one time”—Mr. Brooke still held Dorothea’s hand, but
had turned his face to Mr. Casaubon—“about topography, ruins,
temples—I thought I had a clew, but I saw it would carry me too
far, and nothing might come of it. You may go any length in that
sort of thing, and nothing may come of it, you know.”</p>
<p>Dorothea’s eyes also were turned up to her husband’s face with
some anxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after
absence might be aware of signs which she had not noticed.</p>
<p>“Nothing to alarm you, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, observing her
expression. “A little English beef and mutton will soon make a
difference. It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the
portrait of Aquinas, you know—we got your letter just in time. But
Aquinas, now—he was a little too subtle, wasn’t he? Does anybody
read Aquinas?”</p>
<p>“He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,” said
Mr. Casaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified
patience.</p>
<p>“You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?” said Dorothea,
coming to the rescue.</p>
<p>“Yes; and you must go to Celia: she has great news to tell you,
you know. I leave it all to her.”</p>
<p>The blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was
seated there in a pelisse exactly like her sister’s, surveying the
cameos with a placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on
to other topics.</p>
<p>“Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?” said
Celia, with her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on
the smallest occasions.</p>
<p>“It would not suit all—not you, dear, for example,” said
Dorothea, quietly. No one would ever know what she thought of a
wedding journey to Rome.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long
journey when they are married. She says they get tired to death of
each other, and can’t quarrel comfortably, as they would at home.
And Lady Chettam says she went to Bath.” Celia’s color changed
again and again—seemed</p>
<p class="poem">“To come and go with tidings from the heart,<br/>
As it a running messenger had been."<br/></p>
<p>It must mean more than Celia’s blushing usually did.</p>
<p>“Celia! has something happened?” said Dorothea, in a tone full
of sisterly feeling. “Have you really any great news to tell
me?”</p>
<p>“It was because you went away, Dodo. Then there was nobody but
me for Sir James to talk to,” said Celia, with a certain
roguishness in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I understand. It is as I used to hope and believe,” said
Dorothea, taking her sister’s face between her hands, and looking
at her half anxiously. Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it
used to do.</p>
<p>“It was only three days ago,” said Celia. “And Lady Chettam is
very kind.”</p>
<p>“And you are very happy?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We are not going to be married yet. Because every thing is
to be got ready. And I don’t want to be married so very soon,
because I think it is nice to be engaged. And we shall be married
all our lives after.”</p>
<p>“I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty. Sir James is a
good, honorable man,” said Dorothea, warmly.</p>
<p>“He has gone on with the cottages, Dodo. He will tell you about
them when he comes. Shall you be glad to see him?”</p>
<p>“Of course I shall. How can you ask me?”</p>
<p>“Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned,” said Celia,
regarding Mr. Casaubon’s learning as a kind of damp which might in
due time saturate a neighboring body.</p>
