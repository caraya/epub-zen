<blockquote><p>It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of
their forefathers, and declaim against the wickedness of times
present. Which notwithstanding they cannot handsomely do, without
the borrowed help and satire of times past; condemning the vices of
their own times, by the expressions of vices in times which they
commend, which cannot but argue the community of vice in both.
Horace, therefore, Juvenal, and Persius, were no prophets, although
their lines did seem to indigitate and point at our times.

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">T</span>hat opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had
sketched to Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in
many different lights. He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and
dunderheaded prejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical
jealousy but a determination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by
a hatred of that vital religion of which he had striven to be an
effectual lay representative—a hatred which certainly found
pretexts apart from religion such as were only too easy to find in
the entanglements of human action. These might be called the
ministerial views. But oppositions have the illimitable range of
objections at command, which need never stop short at the boundary
of knowledge, but can draw forever on the vasts of ignorance. What
the opposition in Middlemarch said about the New Hospital and its
administration had certainly a great deal of echo in it, for heaven
has taken care that everybody shall not be an originator; but there
were differences which represented every social shade between the
polished moderation of Dr. Minchin and the trenchant assertion of
Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own
asseveration, that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the
Hospital, if not to poison them, for the sake of cutting them up
without saying by your leave or with your leave; for it was a known
“fac“ that he had wanted to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a
woman as any in Parley Street, who had money in trust before her
marriage—a poor tale for a doctor, who if he was good for anything
should know what was the matter with you before you died, and not
want to pry into your inside after you were gone. If that was not
reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was; but there was a
prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was a bulwark,
and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to the
cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with
their pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not
wanted in Middlemarch!</p>
<p>And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in
Slaughter Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old
authentic public-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of
Dollop’s—was the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some
months before put to the vote whether its long-standing medical
man, “Doctor Gambit,” should not be cashiered in favor of “this
Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of performing the most astonishing
cures, and rescuing people altogether given up by other
practitioners. But the balance had been turned against Lydgate by
two members, who for some private reasons held that this power of
resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal
recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In
the course of the year, however, there had been a change in the
public sentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop’s was an
index.</p>
<p>A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of
Lydgate’s skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,
depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of
the stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts,
but not the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of
evidence. Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long
been worn threadbare, like old Featherstone’s, had been at once
inclined to try him; also, many who did not like paying their
doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of opening an account with a new
doctor and sending for him without stint if the children’s temper
wanted a dose, occasions when the old practitioners were often
crusty; and all persons thus inclined to employ Lydgate held it
likely that he was clever. Some considered that he might do more
than others “where there was liver;”—at least there would be no
harm in getting a few bottles of “stuff“ from him, since if these
proved useless it would still be possible to return to the
Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the
yellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good
Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their
doctor without reason shown; and everybody who had employed Mr.
Peacock did not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the
character of his successor, objecting that he was ”not likely to be
equal to Peacock.“</p>
<p>But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were
particulars enough reported of him to breed much more specific
expectations and to intensify differences into partisanship; some
of the particulars being of that impressive order of which the
significance is entirely hidden, like a statistical amount without
a standard of comparison, but with a note of exclamation at the
end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly swallowed by a full-grown
man—what a shudder they might have created in some Middlemarch
circles! “Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be—is it any wonder
the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who say
quarantine is no good!”</p>
<p>One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not
dispense drugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose
exclusive distinction seemed infringed on, and to the
surgeon-apothecaries with whom he ranged himself; and only a little
while before, they might have counted on having the law on their
side against a man who without calling himself a London-made M.D.
dared to ask for pay except as a charge on drugs. But Lydgate had
not been experienced enough to foresee that his new course would be
even more offensive to the laity; and to Mr. Mawmsey, an important
grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one of his patients,
questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he was
injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his
reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the
character of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public,
if their only mode of getting paid for their work was by their
making out long bills for draughts, boluses, and mixtures.</p>
<p>“It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be
almost as mischievous as quacks,” said Lydgate, rather
thoughtlessly. “To get their own bread they must overdose the
king’s lieges; and that’s a bad sort of treason, Mr.
Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal way.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of
outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was
also asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical
point of view, as well as from his own, he was an important man;
indeed, an exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a
flame-like pyramid, and whose retail deference was of the cordial,
encouraging kind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain
considerate abstinence from letting out the full force of his mind.
It was Mr. Mawmsey’s friendly jocoseness in questioning him which
had set the tone of Lydgate’s reply. But let the wise be warned
against too great readiness at explanation: it multiplies the
sources of mistake, lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go
wrong.</p>
<p>Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the
stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he
had known who the king’s lieges were, giving his “Good morning,
sir, good-morning, sir,” with the air of one who saw everything
clearly enough. But in truth his views were perturbed. For years he
had been paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every
half-crown and eighteen-pence he was certain something measurable
had been delivered. He had done this with satisfaction, including
it among his responsibilities as a husband and father, and
regarding a longer bill than usual as a dignity worth mentioning.
Moreover, in addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to “self
and family,” he had enjoyed the pleasure of forming an acute
judgment as to their immediate effects, so as to give an
intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a practitioner
just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and especially
esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had the
poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont
to say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.</p>
<p>Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man,
which appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop,
when they were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be
made much of as a fertile mother,—generally under attendance more
or less frequent from Mr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks
which required Dr. Minchin.</p>
<p>“Does this Mr. Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking
medicine?” said Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling.
“I should like him to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if
I didn’t take strengthening medicine for a month beforehand. Think
of what I have to provide for calling customers, my dear!”—here
Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an intimate female friend who sat by—“a
large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a round of beef—ham, tongue, et
cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up best is the pink mixture,
not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with <i>your</i> experience,
you could have patience to listen. I should have told him at once
that I knew a little better than that."</p>
<p>“No, no, no,” said Mr. Mawmsey; “I was not going to tell him my
opinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he
didn’t know who he was talking to. I was not to be turned on
<i>his</i> finger. People often pretend to tell me things, when
they might as well say, 'Mawmsey, you're a fool.' But I smile at
it: I humor everybody's weak place. If physic had done harm to self
and family, I should have found it out by this time."</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying
physic was of no use.</p>
<p>“Indeed!“ said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise.
(He was a stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.)
”How will he cure his patients, then?“</p>
<p>“That is what I say,” returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave
weight to her speech by loading her pronouns. “Does <i>he</i>
suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and
go away again?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit,
including very full accounts of his own habits of body and other
affairs; but of course he knew there was no innuendo in her remark,
since his spare time and personal narrative had never been charged
for. So he replied, humorously—</p>
<p>“Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.”</p>
<p>“Not one that I would employ,” said Mrs. Mawmsey. “<i>Others</i>
may do as they please."</p>
<p>Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer’s without
fear of rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of
those hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their
own honesty, and that it might be worth some people’s while to show
him up. Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much
pervaded by the smells of retail trading which suggested the
reduction of cash payments to a balance. And he did not think it
worth his while to show Lydgate up until he knew how. He had not
indeed great resources of education, and had had to work his own
way against a good deal of professional contempt; but he made none
the worse accoucheur for calling the breathing apparatus
“longs.“</p>
<p>Other medical men felt themselves more capable. Mr. Toller
shared the highest practice in the town and belonged to an old
Middlemarch family: there were Tollers in the law and everything
else above the line of retail trade. Unlike our irascible friend
Wrench, he had the easiest way in the world of taking things which
might be supposed to annoy him, being a well-bred, quietly
facetious man, who kept a good house, was very fond of a little
sporting when he could get it, very friendly with Mr. Hawley, and
hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with such pleasant
habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment, bleeding
and blistering and starving his patients, with a dispassionate
disregard to his personal example; but the incongruity favored the
opinion of his ability among his patients, who commonly observed
that Mr. Toller had lazy manners, but his treatment was as active
as you could desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness
into his profession: he was a little slow in coming, but when he
came, he <i>did</i> something. He was a great favorite in his own
circle, and whatever he implied to any one's disadvantage told
doubly from his careless ironical tone.</p>
<p>He naturally got tired of smiling and saying, “Ah!“ when he was
told that Mr. Peacock’s successor did not mean to dispense
medicines; and Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at
a dinner-party, Mr. Toller said, laughingly, ”Dibbitts will get rid
of his stale drugs, then. I’m fond of little Dibbitts—I’m glad he’s
in luck.“</p>
<p>“I see your meaning, Toller,” said Mr. Hackbutt, “and I am
entirely of your opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing
myself to that effect. A medical man should be responsible for the
quality of the drugs consumed by his patients. That is the
rationale of the system of charging which has hitherto obtained;
and nothing is more offensive than this ostentation of reform,
where there is no real amelioration.”</p>
<p>“Ostentation, Hackbutt?” said Mr. Toller, ironically. “I don’t
see that. A man can’t very well be ostentatious of what nobody
believes in. There’s no reform in the matter: the question is,
whether the profit on the drugs is paid to the medical man by the
druggist or by the patient, and whether there shall be extra pay
under the name of attendance.”</p>
<p>“Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,”
said Mr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.</p>
<p>Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely
at a party, getting the more irritable in consequence.</p>
<p>“As to humbug, Hawley,” he said, “that’s a word easy to fling
about. But what I contend against is the way medical men are
fouling their own nest, and setting up a cry about the country as
if a general practitioner who dispenses drugs couldn’t be a
gentleman. I throw back the imputation with scorn. I say, the most
ungentlemanly trick a man can be guilty of is to come among the
members of his profession with innovations which are a libel on
their time-honored procedure. That is my opinion, and I am ready to
maintain it against any one who contradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice
had become exceedingly sharp.</p>
<p>“I can’t oblige you there, Wrench,” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting
his hands into his trouser-pockets.</p>
<p>“My dear fellow,” said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically! and
looking at Mr. Wrench, “the physicians have their toes trodden on
more than we have. If you come to dignity it is a question for
Minchin and Sprague.”</p>
<p>“Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these
infringements?” said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to
offer his lights. “How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to be done there,” said Mr. Hawley. “I looked into it
for Sprague. You’d only break your nose against a damned judge’s
decision.”</p>
<p>“Pooh! no need of law,” said Mr. Toller. “So far as practice is
concerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like
it—certainly not Peacock’s, who have been used to depletion. Pass
the wine.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs.
Mawmsey, who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by
his supposed declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that
those who called him in should watch a little anxiously to see
whether he did “use all the means he might use” in the case. Even
good Mr. Powderell, who in his constant charity of interpretation
was inclined to esteem Lydgate the more for what seemed a
conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his mind disturbed with
doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and could not
abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a similar
occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not
otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing
Mrs. Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had
begun in a remarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict
between his desire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no
“means“ should be lacking, he induced his wife privately to take
Widgeon’s Purifying Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which
arrested every disease at the fountain by setting to work at once
upon the blood. This co-operative measure was not to be mentioned
to Lydgate, and Mr. Powderell himself had no certain reliance on
it, only hoping that it might be attended with a blessing.</p>
<p>But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was
helped by what we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no
doctor ever came newly to a place without making cures that
surprised somebody—cures which may be called fortune’s
testimonials, and deserve as much credit as the written or printed
kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate was attending them,
some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was remarked that the new
doctor with his new ways had at least the merit of bringing people
back from the brink of death. The trash talked on such occasions
was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave precisely the
sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous man would
desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering dislike
of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of
ignorant puffing. But even his proud outspokenness was checked by
the discernment that it was as useless to fight against the
interpretations of ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune”
insisted on using those interpretations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about
alarming symptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked
him to see her then and there, and to give her a certificate for
the Infirmary; whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of
the case as one of tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as
an out-patient. Nancy, calling at home on her way to the Infirmary,
allowed the stay maker and his wife, in whose attic she lodged, to
read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and by this means became a subject of
compassionate conversation in the neighboring shops of Churchyard
Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at first declared to be as
large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in the day to be about
the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that it would have to
be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of “squitchineal“
as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body when taken
enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually ”soopling,” the
squitchineal by eating away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it
happened to be one of Lydgate’s days there. After questioning and
examining her, Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone,
“It’s not tumor: it’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some
steel mixture, and told her to go home and rest, giving her at the
same time a note to Mrs. Larcher, who, she said, was her best
employer, to testify that she was in need of good food.</p>
<p>But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse,
the supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only
wandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker’s wife
went to fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend
Nancy in her own home, until under his treatment she got quite well
and went to work again. But the case continued to be described as
one of tumor in Churchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs.
Larcher also; for when Lydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to
Dr. Minchin, he naturally did not like to say, “The case was not
one of tumor, and I was mistaken in describing it as such,” but
answered, “Indeed! ah! I saw it was a surgical case, not of a fatal
kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed, however, when he had asked at
the Infirmary about the woman he had recommended two days before,
to hear from the house-surgeon, a youngster who was not sorry to
vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what had occurred: he privately
pronounced that it was indecent in a general practitioner to
contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner, and
afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably
inattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground
for valuing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such
rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal
qualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not
clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful
for being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against
Lydgate’s method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his
marvellous skill in the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she
had been rolling and rolling in agonies from the presence of a
tumor both hard and obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to
yield.</p>
<p>How could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady
when she is expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is
altogether mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to
have entered into the nature of diseases would only have added to
his breaches of medical propriety. Thus he had to wince under a
promise of success given by that ignorant praise which misses every
valid quality.</p>
<p>In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop
Trumbull, Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something
better than an every-day doctor, though here too it was an
equivocal advantage that he won. The eloquent auctioneer was seized
with pneumonia, and having been a patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent
for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his intention to patronize. Mr
Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject for trying the expectant
theory upon—watching the course of an interesting disease when left
as much as possible to itself, so that the stages might be noted
for future guidance; and from the air with which he described his
sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like to be taken into his
medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a partner in his
own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much surprise, that his was
a constitution which (always with due watching) might be left to
itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with all
its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the
rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational
procedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a
general benefit to society.</p>
<p>Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the
view that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical
science.</p>
<p>“Never fear, sir; you are not speaking to one who is altogether
ignorant of the vis medicatrix,” said he, with his usual
superiority of expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of
breathing. And he went without shrinking through his abstinence
from drugs, much sustained by application of the thermometer which
implied the importance of his temperature, by the sense that he
furnished objects for the microscope, and by learning many new
words which seemed suited to the dignity of his secretions. For
Lydgate was acute enough to indulge him with a little technical
talk.</p>
<p>It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a
disposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the
strength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not
backward in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned
the quality of patient he had to deal with. The auctioneer was not
an ungenerous man, and liked to give others their due, feeling that
he could afford it. He had caught the words “expectant method,” and
rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the
assurance that Lydgate “knew a thing or two more than the rest of
the doctors—was far better versed in the secrets of his profession
than the majority of his compeers.”</p>
<p>This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had
given to Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal
ground. The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the
shape of rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of
practical criticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who
had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried
notions. His practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from
the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty
generally invited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at
dinner in the best houses; and having to meet a man whom you
dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment. There
was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that
Lydgate was an arrogant young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of
ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to
Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose name was a chief flag of the
anti-Bulstrode party, always defended Lydgate and made a friend of
him, was referred to Farebrother’s unaccountable way of fighting on
both sides.</p>
<p>Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional
disgust at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying
down for the direction of the New Hospital, which were the more
exasperating because there was no present possibility of
interfering with his will and pleasure, everybody except Lord
Medlicote having refused help towards the building, on the ground
that they preferred giving to the Old Infirmary. Mr. Bulstrode met
all the expenses, and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing
the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance
from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had had to spend large sums, and
the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had undertaken it, had
failed during its progress, and before the interior fittings were
begun had retired from the management of the business; and when
referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode
might ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and
masonry, and had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the
Hospital had become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and
he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that
he might rule it dictatorially without any Board; but he had
another favorite object which also required money for its
accomplishment: he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of
Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get considerable
contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile he framed
his plan of management. The Hospital was to be reserved for fever
in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent,
that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative
investigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown
him the importance of, the other medical visitors having a
consultative influence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s
ultimate decisions; and the general management was to be lodged
exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with Mr.
Bulstrode, who were to have votes in the ratio of their
contributions, the Board itself filling up any vacancy in its
numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share
of government.</p>
<p>There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man
in the town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, “we have a capital
house-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow;
we’ll get Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as
any of them, to come over twice a-week, and in case of any
exceptional operation, Protheroe will come from Brassing. I must
work the harder, that’s all, and I have given up my post at the
Infirmary. The plan will flourish in spite of them, and then
they’ll be glad to come in. Things can’t last as they are: there
must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young fellows may be
glad to come and study here.” Lydgate was in high spirits.</p>
<p>“I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,” said
Mr. Bulstrode. “While I see you carrying out high intentions with
vigor, you shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble
confidence that the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts
against the spirit of evil in this town will not be withdrawn.
Suitable directors to assist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr.
Brooke of Tipton has already given me his concurrence, and a pledge
to contribute yearly: he has not specified the sum—probably not a
great one. But he will be a useful member of the board.”</p>
<p>A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would
originate nothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.</p>
<p>The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now.
Neither Dr. Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate’s
knowledge, or his disposition to improve treatment: what they
disliked was his arrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether
deniable. They implied that he was insolent, pretentious, and given
to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which
was the essence of the charlatan.</p>
<p>The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop.
In those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of
Mr. St. John Long, “noblemen and gentlemen” attesting his
extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a
patient.</p>
<p>Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that
“Bulstrode had found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in
religion is sure to like other sorts of charlatans.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, I can imagine,” said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number
of thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; “there are
so many of that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons,
trying to make people straight when the Almighty had made them
crooked.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Mr. Toller, “Cheshire was all right—all fair and
above board. But there’s St. John Long—that’s the kind of fellow we
call a charlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything
about: a fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go
deeper than other people. The other day he was pretending to tap a
man’s brain and get quicksilver out of it.”</p>
<p>“Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people’s
constitutions!” said Mrs. Taft.</p>
<p>After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate
played even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes,
and how much more likely that in his flighty experimenting he
should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients. Especially it
was to be expected, as the landlady of the Tankard had said, that
he would recklessly cut up their dead bodies. For Lydgate having
attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently of a heart-disease not very
clearly expressed in the symptoms, too daringly asked leave of her
relatives to open the body, and thus gave an offence quickly
spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had long resided on
an income such as made this association of her body with the
victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory.</p>
<p>Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of
the Hospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and
silly misconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly
created by his good share of success.</p>
<p>“They will not drive me away,” he said, talking confidentially
in Mr. Farebrother’s study. “I have got a good opportunity here,
for the ends I care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income
enough for our wants. By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as
possible: I have no seductions now away from home and work. And I
am more and more convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate
the homogeneous origin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are
on the same track, and I have been losing time.”</p>
<p>“I have no power of prophecy there,” said Mr. Farebrother, who
had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked;
“but as to the hostility in the town, you’ll weather it if you are
prudent.”</p>
<p>“How am I to be prudent?” said Lydgate, “I just do what comes
before me to do. I can’t help people’s ignorance and spite, any
more than Vesalius could. It isn’t possible to square one’s conduct
to silly conclusions which nobody can foresee.”</p>
<p>“Quite true; I didn’t mean that. I meant only two things. One
is, keep yourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of
course, you can go on doing good work of your own by his help; but
don’t get tied. Perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say
so—and there’s a good deal of that, I own—but personal feeling is
not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions
which make it simply an opinion.”</p>
<p>“Bulstrode is nothing to me,” said Lydgate, carelessly, “except
on public grounds. As to getting very closely united to him, I am
not fond enough of him for that. But what was the other thing you
meant?” said Lydgate, who was nursing his leg as comfortably as
possible, and feeling in no great need of advice.</p>
<p>“Why, this. Take care—experto crede—take care not to get
hampered about money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one
day, that you don’t like my playing at cards so much for money. You
are right enough there. But try and keep clear of wanting small
sums that you haven’t got. I am perhaps talking rather
superfluously; but a man likes to assume superiority over himself,
by holding up his bad example and sermonizing on it.”</p>
<p>Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother’s hints very cordially, though he
would hardly have borne them from another man. He could not help
remembering that he had lately made some debts, but these had
seemed inevitable, and he had no intention now to do more than keep
house in a simple way. The furniture for which he owed would not
want renewing; nor even the stock of wine for a long while.</p>
<p>Many thoughts cheered him at that time—and justly. A man
conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty
hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their
way not without wounds, and who hover in his mind as patron saints,
invisibly helping. At home, that same evening when he had been
chatting with Mr. Farebrother, he had his long legs stretched on
the sofa, his head thrown back, and his hands clasped behind it
according to his favorite ruminating attitude, while Rosamond sat
at the piano, and played one tune after another, of which her
husband only knew (like the emotional elephant he was!) that they
fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious
sea-breezes.</p>
<p>There was something very fine in Lydgate’s look just then, and
any one might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement. In
his dark eyes and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity
which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought—the mind not
searching, but beholding, and the glance seeming to be filled with
what is behind it.</p>
<p>Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair
close to the sofa and opposite her husband’s face.</p>
<p>“Is that enough music for you, my lord?” she said, folding her
hands before her and putting on a little air of meekness.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, if you are tired,” said Lydgate, gently, turning his
eyes and resting them on her, but not otherwise moving. Rosamond’s
presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought
to the lake, and her woman’s instinct in this matter was not
dull.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“What is absorbing you?” she said, leaning forward and bringing
her face nearer to his.</p>
<p>He moved his hands and placed them gently behind her
shoulders.</p>
<p>“I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am
three hundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in
anatomy.”</p>
<p>“I can’t guess,” said Rosamond, shaking her head. “We used to
play at guessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon’s, but not
anatomists.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way he could
get to know anatomy as he did, was by going to snatch bodies at
night, from graveyards and places of execution.”</p>
<p>“Oh!“ said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her pretty face,
”I am very glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought he
might find some less horrible way than that.“</p>
<p>“No, he couldn’t,” said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take
much notice of her answer. “He could only get a complete skeleton
by snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and
burying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead
of night.”</p>
<p>“I hope he is not one of your great heroes,” said Rosamond, half
playfully, half anxiously, “else I shall have you getting up in the
night to go to St. Peter’s churchyard. You know how angry you told
me the people were about Mrs. Goby. You have enemies enough
already.”</p>
<p>“So had Vesalius, Rosy. No wonder the medical fogies in
Middlemarch are jealous, when some of the greatest doctors living
were fierce upon Vesalius because they had believed in Galen, and
he showed that Galen was wrong. They called him a liar and a
poisonous monster. But the facts of the human frame were on his
side; and so he got the better of them.”</p>
<p>“And what happened to him afterwards?” said Rosamond, with some
interest.</p>
<p>“Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did
exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of
his work. Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from
Jerusalem to take a great chair at Padua. He died rather
miserably.”</p>
<p>There was a moment’s pause before Rosamond said, “Do you know,
Tertius, I often wish you had not been a medical man.”</p>
<p>“Nay, Rosy, don’t say that,” said Lydgate, drawing her closer to
him. “That is like saying you wish you had married another
man.”</p>
<p>“Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might
easily have been something else. And your cousins at Quallingham
all think that you have sunk below them in your choice of a
profession.”</p>
<p>“The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!” said Lydgate,
with scorn. “It was like their impudence if they said anything of
the sort to you.”</p>
<p>“Still,“ said Rosamond, ”I do <i>not</i> think it is a nice
profession, dear." We know that she had much quiet perseverance in
her opinion.</p>
<p>“It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,” said
Lydgate, gravely. “And to say that you love me without loving the
medical man in me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you
like eating a peach but don’t like its flavor. Don’t say that
again, dear, it pains me.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Doctor Grave-face,” said Rosy, dimpling, “I will
declare in future that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and
bits of things in phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in
your dying miserably.”</p>
<p>“No, no, not so bad as that,” said Lydgate, giving up
remonstrance and petting her resignedly.</p>
