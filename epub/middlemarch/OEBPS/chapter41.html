        “By swaggering could I never thrive, <br/>
         For the rain it raineth every day.

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">The</span> transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone
forward between Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone
concerning the land attached to Stone Court, had occasioned the
interchange of a letter or two between these personages.</p>
<p>Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing? If it happens
to have been cut in stone, though it lie face down-most for ages on
a forsaken beach, or “rest quietly under the drums and tramplings
of many conquests,” it may end by letting us into the secret of
usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires
ago:—this world being apparently a huge whispering-gallery. Such
conditions are often minutely represented in our petty lifetimes.
As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may
come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar,
through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and
unlock religions, so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an
innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at last be laid open under the
one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the
opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching the progress of
planetary history from the sun, the one result would be just as
much of a coincidence as the other.</p>
<p>Having made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in
calling attention to the existence of low people by whose
interference, however little we may like it, the course of the
world is very much determined. It would be well, certainly, if we
could help to reduce their number, and something might perhaps be
done by not lightly giving occasion to their existence. Socially
speaking, Joshua Rigg would have been generally pronounced a
superfluity. But those who like Peter Featherstone never had a copy
of themselves demanded, are the very last to wait for such a
request either in prose or verse. The copy in this case bore more
of outside resemblance to the mother, in whose sex frog-features,
accompanied with fresh-colored cheeks and a well-rounded figure,
are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers. The
result is sometimes a frog-faced male, desirable, surely, to no
order of intelligent beings. Especially when he is suddenly brought
into evidence to frustrate other people’s expectations—the very
lowest aspect in which a social superfluity can present
himself.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rigg Featherstone’s low characteristics were all of the
sober, water-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of
the day he was always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he
resembled, and old Peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot
almost more calculating, and far more imperturbable, than himself.
I will add that his finger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and
that he meant to marry a well-educated young lady (as yet
unspecified) whose person was good, and whose connections, in a
solid middle-class way, were undeniable. Thus his nails and modesty
were comparable to those of most gentlemen; though his ambition had
been educated only by the opportunities of a clerk and accountant
in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport. He thought the rural
Featherstones very simple absurd people, and they in their turn
regarded his “bringing up” in a seaport town as an exaggeration of
the monstrosity that their brother Peter, and still more Peter’s
property, should have had such belongings.</p>
<p>The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of
the wainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim
than now, when Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with his hands behind
him, looking out on these grounds as their master. But it seemed
doubtful whether he looked out for the sake of contemplation or of
turning his back to a person who stood in the middle of the room,
with his legs considerably apart and his hands in his
trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a contrast to the sleek
and cool Rigg. He was a man obviously on the way towards sixty,
very florid and hairy, with much gray in his bushy whiskers and
thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to disadvantage the
somewhat worn joinings of his clothes, and the air of a swaggerer,
who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of fireworks,
regarding his own remarks on any other person’s performance as
likely to be more interesting than the performance itself.</p>
<p>His name was John Raffles, and he sometimes wrote jocosely
W.A.G. after his signature, observing when he did so, that he was
once taught by Leonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his
name, and that he, Raffles, originated the witticism of calling
that celebrated principal Ba-Lamb. Such were the appearance and
mental flavor of Mr. Raffles, both of which seemed to have a stale
odor of travellers’ rooms in the commercial hotels of that
period.</p>
<p>“Come, now, Josh,” he was saying, in a full rumbling tone, “look
at it in this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale
of years, and you could afford something handsome now to make her
comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Not while you live. Nothing would make her comfortable while
you live,” returned Rigg, in his cool high voice. “What I give her,
you’ll take.”</p>
<p>“You bear me a grudge, Josh, that I know. But come, now—as
between man and man—without humbug—a little capital might enable me
to make a first-rate thing of the shop. The tobacco trade is
growing. I should cut my own nose off in not doing the best I could
at it. I should stick to it like a flea to a fleece for my own
sake. I should always be on the spot. And nothing would make your
poor mother so happy. I’ve pretty well done with my wild
oats—turned fifty-five. I want to settle down in my chimney-corner.
And if I once buckled to the tobacco trade, I could bring an amount
of brains and experience to bear on it that would not be found
elsewhere in a hurry. I don’t want to be bothering you one time
after another, but to get things once for all into the right
channel. Consider that, Josh—as between man and man—and with your
poor mother to be made easy for her life. I was always fond of the
old woman, by Jove!”</p>
<p>“Have you done?” said Mr. Rigg, quietly, without looking away
from the window.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve done,” said Raffles, taking hold of his hat which
stood before him on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical
push.</p>
<p>“Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I
shall believe it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more
reason I shall have for never doing it. Do you think I mean to
forget your kicking me when I was a lad, and eating all the best
victual away from me and my mother? Do you think I forget your
always coming home to sell and pocket everything, and going off
again leaving us in the lurch? I should be glad to see you whipped
at the cart-tail. My mother was a fool to you: she’d no right to
give me a father-in-law, and she’s been punished for it. She shall
have her weekly allowance paid and no more: and that shall be
stopped if you dare to come on to these premises again, or to come
into this country after me again. The next time you show yourself
inside the gates here, you shall be driven off with the dogs and
the wagoner’s whip.”</p>
<p>As Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at
Raffles with his prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as
striking as it could have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was
a most unengaging kickable boy, and Raffles was the rather
thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms and back-parlors. But the advantage
now was on the side of Rigg, and auditors of this conversation
might probably have expected that Raffles would retire with the air
of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a grimace which was habitual
with him whenever he was “out“ in a game; then subsided into a
laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his pocket.</p>
<p>“Come, Josh,” he said, in a cajoling tone, “give us a spoonful
of brandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I’ll go. Honor
bright! I’ll go like a bullet, <i>by</i> Jove!"</p>
<p>“Mind,“ said Rigg, drawing out a bunch of keys, ”if I ever see
you again, I shan’t speak to you. I don’t own you any more than if
I saw a crow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it
but a character for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying
rogue.“</p>
<p>“That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch
his head and wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed.
“I’m very fond of you; <i>by</i> Jove, I am! There's nothing I like
better than plaguing you—you're so like your mother, and I must do
without it. But the brandy and the sovereign's a bargain."</p>
<p>He jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken
bureau with his keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his
movement with the flask that it had become dangerously loose from
its leather covering, and catching sight of a folded paper which
had fallen within the fender, he took it up and shoved it under the
leather so as to make the glass firm.</p>
<p>By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the
flask, and handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him nor
speaking to him. After locking up the bureau again, he walked to
the window and gazed out as impassibly as he had done at the
beginning of the interview, while Raffles took a small allowance
from the flask, screwed it up, and deposited it in his side-pocket,
with provoking slowness, making a grimace at his stepson’s
back.</p>
<p>“Farewell, Josh—and if forever!” said Raffles, turning back his
head as he opened the door.</p>
<p>Rigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day
had turned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows
and the grassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers
who were loading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the
uneasy gait of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country
journeying on foot, looked as incongruous amid this moist rural
quiet and industry as if he had been a baboon escaped from a
menagerie. But there were none to stare at him except the
long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of his appearance
except the little water-rats which rustled away at his
approach.</p>
<p>He was fortunate enough when he got on to the highroad to be
overtaken by the stage-coach, which carried him to Brassing; and
there he took the new-made railway, observing to his
fellow-passengers that he considered it pretty well seasoned now it
had done for Huskisson. Mr. Raffles on most occasions kept up the
sense of having been educated at an academy, and being able, if he
chose, to pass well everywhere; indeed, there was not one of his
fellow-men whom he did not feel himself in a position to ridicule
and torment, confident of the entertainment which he thus gave to
all the rest of the company.</p>
<p>He played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey
had been entirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to
his flask. The paper with which he had wedged it was a letter
signed Nicholas Bulstrode, but Raffles was not likely to disturb it
from its present useful position.</p>
