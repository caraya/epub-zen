<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">W</span>hen Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New
Hospital with Lydgate, had learned from him that there were no
signs of change in Mr. Casaubon's bodily condition beyond the
mental sign of anxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was
silent for a few moments, wondering whether she had said or done
anything to rouse this new anxiety. Lydgate, not willing to let
slip an opportunity of furthering a favorite purpose, ventured to
say—</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether your or Mr.—Casaubon’s attention has been
drawn to the needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it
seem rather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my
fault: it is because there is a fight being made against it by the
other medical men. I think you are generally interested in such
things, for I remember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing
you at Tipton Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some
questions about the way in which the health of the poor was
affected by their miserable housing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite
grateful to you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a
little better. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me
since I have been married. I mean,” she said, after a moment’s
hesitation, “that the people in our village are tolerably
comfortable, and my mind has been too much taken up for me to
inquire further. But here—in such a place as Middlemarch—there must
be a great deal to be done.”</p>
<p>“There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt
energy. “And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely
to Mr. Bulstrode’s exertions, and in a great degree to his money.
But one man can’t do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course
he looked forward to help. And now there’s a mean, petty feud set
up against the thing in the town, by certain persons who want to
make it a failure.”</p>
<p>“What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive
surprise.</p>
<p>“Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the
town would almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In
this stupid world most people never consider that a thing is good
to be done unless it is done by their own set. I had no connection
with Bulstrode before I came here. I look at him quite impartially,
and I see that he has some notions—that he has set things on
foot—which I can turn to good public purpose. If a fair number of
the better educated men went to work with the belief that their
observations might contribute to the reform of medical doctrine and
practice, we should soon see a change for the better. That’s my
point of view. I hold that by refusing to work with Mr. Bulstrode I
should be turning my back on an opportunity of making my profession
more generally serviceable.”</p>
<p>“I quite agree with you,” said Dorothea, at once fascinated by
the situation sketched in Lydgate’s words. “But what is there
against Mr. Bulstrode? I know that my uncle is friendly with
him.”</p>
<p>“People don’t like his religious tone,” said Lydgate, breaking
off there.</p>
<p>“That is all the stronger reason for despising such an
opposition,” said Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch
by the light of the great persecutions.</p>
<p>“To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to
him:—he is masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned
with trade, which has complaints of its own that I know nothing
about. But what has that to do with the question whether it would
not be a fine thing to establish here a more valuable hospital than
any they have in the county? The immediate motive to the
opposition, however, is the fact that Bulstrode has put the medical
direction into my hands. Of course I am glad of that. It gives me
an opportunity of doing some good work,—and I am aware that I have
to justify his choice of me. But the consequence is, that the whole
profession in Middlemarch have set themselves tooth and nail
against the Hospital, and not only refuse to cooperate themselves,
but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder subscriptions.”</p>
<p>“How very petty!” exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.</p>
<p>“I suppose one must expect to fight one’s way: there is hardly
anything to be done without it. And the ignorance of people about
here is stupendous. I don’t lay claim to anything else than having
used some opportunities which have not come within everybody’s
reach; but there is no stifling the offence of being young, and a
new-comer, and happening to know something more than the old
inhabitants. Still, if I believe that I can set going a better
method of treatment—if I believe that I can pursue certain
observations and inquiries which may be a lasting benefit to
medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I allowed any
consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And the course is
all the clearer from there being no salary in question to put my
persistence in an equivocal light.”</p>
<p>“I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,” said Dorothea,
cordially. “I feel sure I can help a little. I have some money, and
don’t know what to do with it—that is often an uncomfortable
thought to me. I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand
purpose like this. How happy you must be, to know things that you
feel sure will do great good! I wish I could awake with that
knowledge every morning. There seems to be so much trouble taken
that one can hardly see the good of!”</p>
<p>There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea’s voice as she spoke
these last words. But she presently added, more cheerfully, “Pray
come to Lowick and tell us more of this. I will mention the subject
to Mr. Casaubon. I must hasten home now.”</p>
<p>She did mention it that evening, and said that she should like
to subscribe two hundred a-year—she had seven hundred a-year as the
equivalent of her own fortune, settled on her at her marriage. Mr.
Casaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum
might be disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but
when Dorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion, he
acquiesced. He did not care himself about spending money, and was
not reluctant to give it. If he ever felt keenly any question of
money it was through the medium of another passion than the love of
material property.</p>
<p>Dorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate, and recited the
gist of her conversation with him about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon
did not question her further, but he felt sure that she had wished
to know what had passed between Lydgate and himself “She knows that
I know,” said the ever-restless voice within; but that increase of
tacit knowledge only thrust further off any confidence between
them. He distrusted her affection; and what loneliness is more
lonely than distrust?</p>
