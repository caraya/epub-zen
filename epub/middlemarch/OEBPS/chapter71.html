<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">F</span>ive days after the death of Raffles, Mr. Bambridge was standing
at his leisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the
Green Dragon. He was not fond of solitary contemplation, but he had
only just come out of the house, and any human figure standing at
ease under the archway in the early afternoon was as certain to
attract companionship as a pigeon which has found something worth
peeking at. In this case there was no material object to feed upon,
but the eye of reason saw a probability of mental sustenance in the
shape of gossip. Mr. Hopkins, the meek-mannered draper opposite,
was the first to act on this inward vision, being the more
ambitious of a little masculine talk because his customers were
chiefly women. Mr. Bambridge was rather curt to the draper, feeling
that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to <i>him</i>, but that he
was not going to waste much of his talk on Hopkins. Soon, however,
there was a small cluster of more important listeners, who were
either deposited from the passers-by, or had sauntered to the spot
expressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green
Dragon; and Mr. Bambridge was finding it worth his while to say
many impressive things about the fine studs he had been seeing and
the purchases he had made on a journey in the north from which he
had just returned. Gentlemen present were assured that when they
could show him anything to cut out a blood mare, a bay, rising
four, which was to be seen at Doncaster if they chose to go and
look at it, Mr. Bambridge would gratify them by being shot "from
here to Hereford." Also, a pair of blacks which he was going to put
into the break recalled vividly to his mind a pair which he had
sold to Faulkner in '19, for a hundred guineas, and which Faulkner
had sold for a hundred and sixty two months later—any gent who
could disprove this statement being offered the privilege of
calling Mr. Bambridge by a very ugly name until the exercise made
his throat dry.</p>
<p>When the discourse was at this point of animation, came up Mr.
Frank Hawley. He was not a man to compromise his dignity by
lounging at the Green Dragon, but happening to pass along the High
Street and seeing Bambridge on the other side, he took some of his
long strides across to ask the horsedealer whether he had found the
first-rate gig-horse which he had engaged to look for. Mr. Hawley
was requested to wait until he had seen a gray selected at Bilkley:
if that did not meet his wishes to a hair, Bambridge did not know a
horse when he saw it, which seemed to be the highest conceivable
unlikelihood. Mr. Hawley, standing with his back to the street, was
fixing a time for looking at the gray and seeing it tried, when a
horseman passed slowly by.</p>
<p>“Bulstrode!“ said two or three voices at once in a low tone, one
of them, which was the draper’s, respectfully prefixing the ”Mr.;”
but nobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than
if they had said “the Riverston coach” when that vehicle appeared
in the distance. Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at
Bulstrode’s back, but as Bambridge’s eyes followed it he made a
sarcastic grimace.</p>
<p>“By jingo! that reminds me,” he began, lowering his voice a
little, “I picked up something else at Bilkley besides your
gig-horse, Mr. Hawley. I picked up a fine story about Bulstrode. Do
you know how he came by his fortune? Any gentleman wanting a bit of
curious information, I can give it him free of expense. If
everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode might have had to say his
prayers at Botany Bay.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his hands into
his pockets, and pushing a little forward under the archway. If
Bulstrode should turn out to be a rascal, Frank Hawley had a
prophetic soul.</p>
<p>“I had it from a party who was an old chum of Bulstrode’s. I’ll
tell you where I first picked him up,” said Bambridge, with a
sudden gesture of his fore-finger. “He was at Larcher’s sale, but I
knew nothing of him then—he slipped through my fingers—was after
Bulstrode, no doubt. He tells me he can tap Bulstrode to any
amount, knows all his secrets. However, he blabbed to me at
Bilkley: he takes a stiff glass. Damme if I think he meant to turn
king’s evidence; but he’s that sort of bragging fellow, the
bragging runs over hedge and ditch with him, till he’d brag of a
spavin as if it ’ud fetch money. A man should know when to pull
up.” Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of disgust,
satisfied that his own bragging showed a fine sense of the
marketable.</p>
<p>“What’s the man’s name? Where can he be found?” said Mr.
Hawley.</p>
<p>“As to where he is to be found, I left him to it at the
Saracen’s Head; but his name is Raffles.”</p>
<p>“Raffles!“ exclaimed Mr. Hopkins. ”I furnished his funeral
yesterday. He was buried at Lowick. Mr. Bulstrode followed him. A
very decent funeral.“ There was a strong sensation among the
listeners. Mr. Bambridge gave an ejaculation in which ”brimstone”
was the mildest word, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his brows and
bending his head forward, exclaimed, “What?—where did the man
die?”</p>
<p>“At Stone Court,” said the draper. “The housekeeper said he was
a relation of the master’s. He came there ill on Friday.”</p>
<p>“Why, it was on Wednesday I took a glass with him,” interposed
Bambridge.</p>
<p>“Did any doctor attend him?” said Mr. Hawley</p>
<p>“Yes. Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Bulstrode sat up with him one night. He
died the third morning.”</p>
<p>“Go on, Bambridge,” said Mr. Hawley, insistently. “What did this
fellow say about Bulstrode?”</p>
<p>The group had already become larger, the town-clerk’s presence
being a guarantee that something worth listening to was going on
there; and Mr. Bambridge delivered his narrative in the hearing of
seven. It was mainly what we know, including the fact about Will
Ladislaw, with some local color and circumstance added: it was what
Bulstrode had dreaded the betrayal of—and hoped to have buried
forever with the corpse of Raffles—it was that haunting ghost of
his earlier life which as he rode past the archway of the Green
Dragon he was trusting that Providence had delivered him from. Yes,
Providence. He had not confessed to himself yet that he had done
anything in the way of contrivance to this end; he had accepted
what seemed to have been offered. It was impossible to prove that
he had done anything which hastened the departure of that man’s
soul.</p>
<p>But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like
the smell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by
sending a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of
inquiring about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned
about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came
to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court
in his gig; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of
seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether he had time to
undertake an arbitration if it were required, and then asking him
incidentally about Raffles. Caleb was betrayed into no word
injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which he was forced to
admit, that he had given up acting for him within the last week. Mr
Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that Raffles had
told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up Bulstrode’s
affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller.
The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp of an
inference, and was taken as information coming straight from Garth,
so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to be
the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanors.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for
the law either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the
circumstances of his death. He had himself ridden to Lowick village
that he might look at the register and talk over the whole matter
with Mr. Farebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer
that an ugly secret should have come to light about Bulstrode,
though he had always had justice enough in him to hinder his
antipathy from turning into conclusions. But while they were
talking another combination was silently going forward in Mr.
Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed what was soon to be loudly
spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary “putting of two and two
together.” With the reasons which kept Bulstrode in dread of
Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread might have
something to do with his munificence towards his medical man; and
though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously
accepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this
complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s
reputation. He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of
the sudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide
away from all approaches towards the subject.</p>
<p>“Well,“ he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the
illimitable discussion of what might have been, though nothing
could be legally proven, ”it is a strange story. So our mercurial
Ladislaw has a queer genealogy! A high-spirited young lady and a
musical Polish patriot made a likely enough stock for him to spring
from, but I should never have suspected a grafting of the Jew
pawnbroker. However, there’s no knowing what a mixture will turn
out beforehand. Some sorts of dirt serve to clarify.“</p>
<p>“It’s just what I should have expected,” said Mr. Hawley,
mounting his horse. “Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or
Gypsy.”</p>
<p>“I know he’s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he is really a
disinterested, unworldly fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother,
smiling.</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,” said Mr. Hawley, who had
been in the habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was
such a damned pleasant good-hearted fellow you would mistake him
for a Tory.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on
Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side
of Bulstrode. But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able
not only to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all
his debts in Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it
conjectures and comments which gave it new body and impetus, and
soon filling the ears of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were
not slow to see a significant relation between this sudden command
of money and Bulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles.
That the money came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been
guessed even if there had been no direct evidence of it; for it had
beforehand entered into the gossip about Lydgate’s affairs, that
neither his father-in-law nor his own family would do anything for
him, and direct evidence was furnished not only by a clerk at the
Bank, but by innocent Mrs. Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the
loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who mentioned it to her daughter-in-law of
the house of Toller, who mentioned it generally. The business was
felt to be so public and important that it required dinners to feed
it, and many invitations were just then issued and accepted on the
strength of this scandal concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives,
widows, and single ladies took their work and went out to tea
oftener than usual; and all public conviviality, from the Green
Dragon to Dollop’s, gathered a zest which could not be won from the
question whether the Lords would throw out the Reform Bill.</p>
<p>For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other
was at the bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley
indeed, in the first instance, invited a select party, including
the two physicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to
hold a close discussion as to the probabilities of Raffles’s
illness, reciting to them all the particulars which had been
gathered from Mrs. Abel in connection with Lydgate’s certificate,
that the death was due to delirium tremens; and the medical
gentlemen, who all stood undisturbedly on the old paths in relation
to this disease, declared that they could see nothing in these
particulars which could be transformed into a positive ground of
suspicion. But the moral grounds of suspicion remained: the strong
motives Bulstrode clearly had for wishing to be rid of Raffles, and
the fact that at this critical moment he had given Lydgate the help
which he must for some time have known the need for; the
disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode would be
unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe that
Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when
they have found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had
been given merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of
Bulstrode’s earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on
Lydgate, who had long been sneered at as making himself subservient
to the banker for the sake of working himself into predominance,
and discrediting the elder members of his profession. Hence, in
spite of the negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to
the death at Stone Court, Mr. Hawley’s select party broke up with
the sense that the affair had “an ugly look.”</p>
<p>But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was
enough to keep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among
substantial professional seniors, had for the general mind all the
superior power of mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to
conjecture how the thing was, than simply to know it; for
conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge, and had a
more liberal allowance for the incompatible. Even the more definite
scandal concerning Bulstrode’s earlier life was, for some minds,
melted into the mass of mystery, as so much lively metal to be
poured out in dialogue, and to take such fantastic shapes as heaven
pleased.</p>
<p>This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop,
the spirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had
often to resist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to
think that their reports from the outer world were of equal force
with what had “come up” in her mind. How it had been brought to her
she didn’t know, but it was there before her as if it had been
“scored with the chalk on the chimney-board—” as Bulstrode should
say, “his inside was <i>that black</i> as if the hairs of his head
knowed the thoughts of his heart, he'd tear 'em up by the
roots."</p>
<p>“That’s odd,” said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak
eyes and a piping voice. “Why, I read in the ’Trumpet’ that was
what the Duke of Wellington said when he turned his coat and went
over to the Romans.”</p>
<p>“Very like,” said Mrs. Dollop. “If one raskill said it, it’s
more reason why another should. But hypo<i>crite</i> as he's been,
and holding things with that high hand, as there was no parson i'
the country good enough for him, he was forced to take Old Harry
into his counsel, and Old Harry's been too many for him."</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, he’s a ’complice you can’t send out o’ the country,”
said Mr. Crabbe, the glazier, who gathered much news and groped
among it dimly. “But by what I can make out, there’s them says
Bulstrode was for running away, for fear o’ being found out, before
now.”</p>
<p>“He’ll be drove away, whether or no,” said Mr. Dill, the barber,
who had just dropped in. “I shaved Fletcher, Hawley’s clerk, this
morning—he’s got a bad finger—and he says they’re all of one mind
to get rid of Bulstrode. Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and
wants him out o’ the parish. And there’s gentlemen in this town
says they’d as soon dine with a fellow from the hulks. ’And a deal
sooner I would,’ says Fletcher; ’for what’s more against one’s
stomach than a man coming and making himself bad company with his
religion, and giving out as the Ten Commandments are not enough for
him, and all the while he’s worse than half the men at the
tread-mill?’ Fletcher said so himself.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode’s money
goes out of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.</p>
<p>“Ah, there’s better folks spend their money worse,” said a
firm-voiced dyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with
his good-natured face.</p>
<p>“But he won’t keep his money, by what I can make out,” said the
glazier. “Don’t they say as there’s somebody can strip it off him?
By what I can understan’, they could take every penny off him, if
they went to lawing.”</p>
<p>“No such thing!” said the barber, who felt himself a little
above his company at Dollop’s, but liked it none the worse.
“Fletcher says it’s no such thing. He says they might prove over
and over again whose child this young Ladislaw was, and they’d do
no more than if they proved I came out of the Fens—he couldn’t
touch a penny.”</p>
<p>“Look you there now!” said Mrs. Dollop, indignantly. “I thank
the Lord he took my children to Himself, if that’s all the law can
do for the motherless. Then by that, it’s o’ no use who your father
and mother is. But as to listening to what one lawyer says without
asking another—I wonder at a man o’ your cleverness, Mr. Dill. It’s
well known there’s always two sides, if no more; else who’d go to
law, I should like to know? It’s a poor tale, with all the law as
there is up and down, if it’s no use proving whose child you are.
Fletcher may say that if he likes, but I say, don’t Fletcher
<i>me</i>!"</p>
<p>Mr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs.
Dollop, as a woman who was more than a match for the lawyers; being
disposed to submit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long
score against him.</p>
<p>“If they come to lawing, and it’s all true as folks say, there’s
more to be looked to nor money,” said the glazier. “There’s this
poor creetur as is dead and gone; by what I can make out, he’d seen
the day when he was a deal finer gentleman nor Bulstrode.”</p>
<p>“Finer gentleman! I’ll warrant him,” said Mrs. Dollop; “and a
far personabler man, by what I can hear. As I said when Mr.
Baldwin, the tax-gatherer, comes in, a-standing where you sit, and
says, ’Bulstrode got all his money as he brought into this town by
thieving and swindling,’—I said, ’You don’t make me no wiser, Mr.
Baldwin: it’s set my blood a-creeping to look at him ever sin’ here
he came into Slaughter Lane a-wanting to buy the house over my
head: folks don’t look the color o’ the dough-tub and stare at you
as if they wanted to see into your backbone for nothingk.’ That was
what I said, and Mr. Baldwin can bear me witness.”</p>
<p>“And in the rights of it too,” said Mr. Crabbe. “For by what I
can make out, this Raffles, as they call him, was a lusty,
fresh-colored man as you’d wish to see, and the best o’
company—though dead he lies in Lowick churchyard sure enough; and
by what I can understan’, there’s them knows more than they
<i>should</i> know about how he got there."</p>
<p>“I’ll believe you!” said Mrs. Dallop, with a touch of scorn at
Mr. Crabbe’s apparent dimness. “When a man’s been ’ticed to a lone
house, and there’s them can pay for hospitals and nurses for half
the country-side choose to be sitters-up night and day, and nobody
to come near but a doctor as is known to stick at nothingk, and as
poor as he can hang together, and after that so flush o’ money as
he can pay off Mr. Byles the butcher as his bill has been running
on for the best o’ joints since last Michaelmas was a twelvemonth—I
don’t want anybody to come and tell me as there’s been more going
on nor the Prayer-book’s got a service for—I don’t want to stand
winking and blinking and thinking.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dollop looked round with the air of a landlady accustomed
to dominate her company. There was a chorus of adhesion from the
more courageous; but Mr. Limp, after taking a draught, placed his
flat hands together and pressed them hard between his knees,
looking down at them with blear-eyed contemplation, as if the
scorching power of Mrs. Dollop’s speech had quite dried up and
nullified his wits until they could be brought round again by
further moisture.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t they dig the man up and have the Crowner?” said
the dyer. “It’s been done many and many’s the time. If there’s been
foul play they might find it out.”</p>
<p>“Not they, Mr. Jonas!” said Mrs Dollop, emphatically. “I know
what doctors are. They’re a deal too cunning to be found out. And
this Doctor Lydgate that’s been for cutting up everybody before the
breath was well out o’ their body—it’s plain enough what use he
wanted to make o’ looking into respectable people’s insides. He
knows drugs, you may be sure, as you can neither smell nor see,
neither before they’re swallowed nor after. Why, I’ve seen drops
myself ordered by Doctor Gambit, as is our club doctor and a good
charikter, and has brought more live children into the world nor
ever another i’ Middlemarch—I say I’ve seen drops myself as made no
difference whether they was in the glass or out, and yet have
griped you the next day. So I’ll leave your own sense to judge.
Don’t tell me! All I say is, it’s a mercy they didn’t take this
Doctor Lydgate on to our club. There’s many a mother’s child might
ha’ rued it.”</p>
<p>The heads of this discussion at “Dollop’s“ had been the common
theme among all classes in the town, had been carried to Lowick
Parsonage on one side and to Tipton Grange on the other, had come
fully to the ears of the Vincy family, and had been discussed with
sad reference to ”poor Harriet“ by all Mrs. Bulstrode’s friends,
before Lydgate knew distinctly why people were looking strangely at
him, and before Bulstrode himself suspected the betrayal of his
secrets. He had not been accustomed to very cordial relations with
his neighbors, and hence he could not miss the signs of cordiality;
moreover, he had been taking journeys on business of various kinds,
having now made up his mind that he need not quit Middlemarch, and
feeling able consequently to determine on matters which he had
before left in suspense.</p>
<p>“We will make a journey to Cheltenham in the course of a month
or two,” he had said to his wife. “There are great spiritual
advantages to be had in that town along with the air and the
waters, and six weeks there will be eminently refreshing to
us.”</p>
<p>He really believed in the spiritual advantages, and meant that
his life henceforth should be the more devoted because of those
later sins which he represented to himself as hypothetic, praying
hypothetically for their pardon:—“if I have herein
transgressed.”</p>
<p>As to the Hospital, he avoided saying anything further to
Lydgate, fearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans
immediately on the death of Raffles. In his secret soul he believed
that Lydgate suspected his orders to have been intentionally
disobeyed, and suspecting this he must also suspect a motive. But
nothing had been betrayed to him as to the history of Raffles, and
Bulstrode was anxious not to do anything which would give emphasis
to his undefined suspicions. As to any certainty that a particular
method of treatment would either save or kill, Lydgate himself was
constantly arguing against such dogmatism; he had no right to
speak, and he had every motive for being silent. Hence Bulstrode
felt himself providentially secured. The only incident he had
strongly winced under had been an occasional encounter with Caleb
Garth, who, however, had raised his hat with mild gravity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the part of the principal townsmen a strong
determination was growing against him.</p>
<p>A meeting was to be held in the Town-Hall on a sanitary question
which had risen into pressing importance by the occurrence of a
cholera case in the town. Since the Act of Parliament, which had
been hurriedly passed, authorizing assessments for sanitary
measures, there had been a Board for the superintendence of such
measures appointed in Middlemarch, and much cleansing and
preparation had been concurred in by Whigs and Tories. The question
now was, whether a piece of ground outside the town should be
secured as a burial-ground by means of assessment or by private
subscription. The meeting was to be open, and almost everybody of
importance in the town was expected to be there.</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode was a member of the Board, and just before twelve
o’clock he started from the Bank with the intention of urging the
plan of private subscription. Under the hesitation of his projects,
he had for some time kept himself in the background, and he felt
that he should this morning resume his old position as a man of
action and influence in the public affairs of the town where he
expected to end his days. Among the various persons going in the
same direction, he saw Lydgate; they joined, talked over the object
of the meeting, and entered it together.</p>
<p>It seemed that everybody of mark had been earlier than they. But
there were still spaces left near the head of the large central
table, and they made their way thither. Mr. Farebrother sat
opposite, not far from Mr. Hawley; all the medical men were there;
Mr. Thesiger was in the chair, and Mr. Brooke of Tipton was on his
right hand.</p>
<p>Lydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he and
Bulstrode took their seats.</p>
<p>After the business had been fully opened by the chairman, who
pointed out the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of
ground large enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery,
Mr. Bulstrode, whose rather high-pitched but subdued and fluent
voice the town was used to at meetings of this sort, rose and asked
leave to deliver his opinion. Lydgate could see again the peculiar
interchange of glances before Mr. Hawley started up, and said in
his firm resonant voice, “Mr. Chairman, I request that before any
one delivers his opinion on this point I may be permitted to speak
on a question of public feeling, which not only by myself, but by
many gentlemen present, is regarded as preliminary.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hawley’s mode of speech, even when public decorum repressed
his “awful language,” was formidable in its curtness and
self-possession. Mr. Thesiger sanctioned the request, Mr. Bulstrode
sat down, and Mr. Hawley continued.</p>
<p>“In what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking simply
on my own behalf: I am speaking with the concurrence and at the
express request of no fewer than eight of my fellow-townsmen, who
are immediately around us. It is our united sentiment that Mr.
Bulstrode should be called upon—and I do now call upon him—to
resign public positions which he holds not simply as a tax-payer,
but as a gentleman among gentlemen. There are practices and there
are acts which, owing to circumstances, the law cannot visit,
though they may be worse than many things which are legally
punishable. Honest men and gentlemen, if they don’t want the
company of people who perpetrate such acts, have got to defend
themselves as they best can, and that is what I and the friends
whom I may call my clients in this affair are determined to do. I
don’t say that Mr. Bulstrode has been guilty of shameful acts, but
I call upon him either publicly to deny and confute the scandalous
statements made against him by a man now dead, and who died in his
house—the statement that he was for many years engaged in nefarious
practices, and that he won his fortune by dishonest procedures—or
else to withdraw from positions which could only have been allowed
him as a gentleman among gentlemen.”</p>
<p>All eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode, who, since
the first mention of his name, had been going through a crisis of
feeling almost too violent for his delicate frame to support.
Lydgate, who himself was undergoing a shock as from the terrible
practical interpretation of some faint augury, felt, nevertheless,
that his own movement of resentful hatred was checked by that
instinct of the Healer which thinks first of bringing rescue or
relief to the sufferer, when he looked at the shrunken misery of
Bulstrode’s livid face.</p>
<p>The quick vision that his life was after all a failure, that he
was a dishonored man, and must quail before the glance of those
towards whom he had habitually assumed the attitude of a
reprover—that God had disowned him before men and left him
unscreened to the triumphant scorn of those who were glad to have
their hatred justified—the sense of utter futility in that
equivocation with his conscience in dealing with the life of his
accomplice, an equivocation which now turned venomously upon him
with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie:—all this rushed
through him like the agony of terror which fails to kill, and
leaves the ears still open to the returning wave of execration. The
sudden sense of exposure after the re-established sense of safety
came—not to the coarse organization of a criminal but to—the
susceptible nerve of a man whose intensest being lay in such
mastery and predominance as the conditions of his life had shaped
for him.</p>
<p>But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction. Through
all his bodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious
self-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a
flame, scattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he sat
an object of compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and
glow under his ashy paleness. Before the last words were out of Mr.
Hawley’s mouth, Bulstrode felt that he should answer, and that his
answer would be a retort. He dared not get up and say, “I am not
guilty, the whole story is false”—even if he had dared this, it
would have seemed to him, under his present keen sense of betrayal,
as vain as to pull, for covering to his nakedness, a frail rag
which would rend at every little strain.</p>
<p>For a few moments there was total silence, while every man in
the room was looking at Bulstrode. He sat perfectly still, leaning
hard against the back of his chair; he could not venture to rise,
and when he began to speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on
each side of him. But his voice was perfectly audible, though
hoarser than usual, and his words were distinctly pronounced,
though he paused between sentence as if short of breath. He said,
turning first toward Mr. Thesiger, and then looking at Mr.
Hawley—</p>
<p>“I protest before you, sir, as a Christian minister, against the
sanction of proceedings towards me which are dictated by virulent
hatred. Those who are hostile to me are glad to believe any libel
uttered by a loose tongue against me. And their consciences become
strict against me. Say that the evil-speaking of which I am to be
made the victim accuses me of malpractices—” here Bulstrode’s voice
rose and took on a more biting accent, till it seemed a low
cry—“who shall be my accuser? Not men whose own lives are
unchristian, nay, scandalous—not men who themselves use low
instruments to carry out their ends—whose profession is a tissue of
chicanery—who have been spending their income on their own sensual
enjoyments, while I have been devoting mine to advance the best
objects with regard to this life and the next.”</p>
<p>After the word chicanery there was a growing noise, half of
murmurs and half of hisses, while four persons started up at
once—Mr. Hawley, Mr. Toller, Mr. Chichely, and Mr. Hackbutt; but
Mr. Hawley’s outburst was instantaneous, and left the others behind
in silence.</p>
<p>“If you mean me, sir, I call you and every one else to the
inspection of my professional life. As to Christian or unchristian,
I repudiate your canting palavering Christianity; and as to the way
in which I spend my income, it is not my principle to maintain
thieves and cheat offspring of their due inheritance in order to
support religion and set myself up as a saintly Killjoy. I affect
no niceness of conscience—I have not found any nice standards
necessary yet to measure your actions by, sir. And I again call
upon you to enter into satisfactory explanations concerning the
scandals against you, or else to withdraw from posts in which we at
any rate decline you as a colleague. I say, sir, we decline to
co-operate with a man whose character is not cleared from infamous
lights cast upon it, not only by reports but by recent
actions.”</p>
<p>“Allow me, Mr. Hawley,” said the chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still
fuming, bowed half impatiently, and sat down with his hands thrust
deep in his pockets.</p>
<p>“Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think, to prolong the
present discussion,” said Mr. Thesiger, turning to the pallid
trembling man; “I must so far concur with what has fallen from Mr.
Hawley in expression of a general feeling, as to think it due to
your Christian profession that you should clear yourself, if
possible, from unhappy aspersions. I for my part should be willing
to give you full opportunity and hearing. But I must say that your
present attitude is painfully inconsistent with those principles
which you have sought to identify yourself with, and for the honor
of which I am bound to care. I recommend you at present, as your
clergyman, and one who hopes for your reinstatement in respect, to
quit the room, and avoid further hindrance to business.”</p>
<p>Bulstrode, after a moment’s hesitation, took his hat from the
floor and slowly rose, but he grasped the corner of the chair so
totteringly that Lydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in
him to walk away without support. What could he do? He could not
see a man sink close to him for want of help. He rose and gave his
arm to Bulstrode, and in that way led him out of the room; yet this
act, which might have been one of gentle duty and pure compassion,
was at this moment unspeakably bitter to him. It seemed as if he
were putting his sign-manual to that association of himself with
Bulstrode, of which he now saw the full meaning as it must have
presented itself to other minds. He now felt the conviction that
this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm, had given him the
thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the treatment of
Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive. The inferences
were closely linked enough; the town knew of the loan, believed it
to be a bribe, and believed that he took it as a bribe.</p>
<p>Poor Lydgate, his mind struggling under the terrible clutch of
this revelation, was all the while morally forced to take Mr.
Bulstrode to the Bank, send a man off for his carriage, and wait to
accompany him home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched, and
fringed off into eager discussion among various groups concerning
this affair of Bulstrode—and Lydgate.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke, who had before heard only imperfect hints of it, and
was very uneasy that he had “gone a little too far” in
countenancing Bulstrode, now got himself fully informed, and felt
some benevolent sadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the
ugly light in which Lydgate had come to be regarded. Mr.
Farebrother was going to walk back to Lowick.</p>
<p>“Step into my carriage,” said Mr. Brooke. “I am going round to
see Mrs. Casaubon. She was to come back from Yorkshire last night.
She will like to see me, you know.”</p>
<p>So they drove along, Mr. Brooke chatting with good-natured hope
that there had not really been anything black in Lydgate’s
behavior—a young fellow whom he had seen to be quite above the
common mark, when he brought a letter from his uncle Sir Godwin.
Mr. Farebrother said little: he was deeply mournful: with a keen
perception of human weakness, he could not be confident that under
the pressure of humiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below
himself.</p>
<p>When the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor, Dorothea
was out on the gravel, and came to greet them.</p>
<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have just come from a
meeting—a sanitary meeting, you know.”</p>
<p>“Was Mr. Lydgate there?” said Dorothea, who looked full of
health and animation, and stood with her head bare under the
gleaming April lights. “I want to see him and have a great
consultation with him about the Hospital. I have engaged with Mr.
Bulstrode to do so.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have been hearing bad
news—bad news, you know.”</p>
<p>They walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate, Mr.
Farebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage; and Dorothea heard
the whole sad story.</p>
<p>She listened with deep interest, and begged to hear twice over
the facts and impressions concerning Lydgate. After a short
silence, pausing at the churchyard gate, and addressing Mr.
Farebrother, she said energetically—</p>
<p>“You don’t believe that Mr. Lydgate is guilty of anything base?
I will not believe it. Let us find out the truth and clear
him!”</p>
