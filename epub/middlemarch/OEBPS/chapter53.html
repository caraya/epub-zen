<blockquote><p>It is but a shallow haste which concludeth
insincerity from what outsiders call inconsistency—putting a dead
mechanism of “ifs“ and ”therefores” for the living myriad of hidden
suckers whereby the belief and the conduct are wrought into mutual
sustainment.</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">Mr.</span> Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in
Lowick, had naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman
should be one whom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be
a chastisement and admonition directed to his own shortcomings and
those of the nation at large, that just about the time when he came
in possession of the deeds which made him the proprietor of Stone
Court, Mr. Farebrother "read himself" into the quaint little church
and preached his first sermon to the congregation of farmers,
laborers, and village artisans. It was not that Mr. Bulstrode
intended to frequent Lowick Church or to reside at Stone Court for
a good while to come: he had bought the excellent farm and fine
homestead simply as a retreat which he might gradually enlarge as
to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until it should be
conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it as a
residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the
administration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the
side of Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship,
which Providence might increase by unforeseen occasions of
purchase. A strong leading in this direction seemed to have been
given in the surprising facility of getting Stone Court, when every
one had expected that Mr. Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it
as the Garden of Eden. That was what poor old Peter himself had
expected; having often, in imagination, looked up through the sods
above him, and, unobstructed by. perspective, seen his frog-faced
legatee enjoying the fine old place to the perpetual surprise and
disappointment of other survivors.</p>
<p>But how little we know what would make paradise for our
neighbors! We judge from our own desires, and our neighbors
themselves are not always open enough even to throw out a hint of
theirs. The cool and judicious Joshua Rigg had not allowed his
parent to perceive that Stone Court was anything less than the
chief good in his estimation, and he had certainly wished to call
it his own. But as Warren Hastings looked at gold and thought of
buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone Court and thought
of buying gold. He had a very distinct and intense vision of his
chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited having taken
a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good was to
be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy in
a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers
as other boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the
fascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special
passion; he meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of
them being to marry a genteel young person; but these were all
accidents and joys that imagination could dispense with. The one
joy after which his soul thirsted was to have a money-changer’s
shop on a much-frequented quay, to have locks all round him of
which he held the keys, and to look sublimely cool as he handled
the breeding coins of all nations, while helpless Cupidity looked
at him enviously from the other side of an iron lattice. The
strength of that passion had been a power enabling him to master
all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when others were
thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life, Joshua
himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he
should settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes
and locks.</p>
<p>Enough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of
his land from Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it
as a cheering dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a
purpose which he had for some time entertained without external
encouragement; he interpreted it thus, but not too confidently,
offering up his thanksgiving in guarded phraseology. His doubts did
not arise from the possible relations of the event to Joshua Rigg’s
destiny, which belonged to the unmapped regions not taken under the
providential government, except perhaps in an imperfect colonial
way; but they arose from reflecting that this dispensation too
might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr. Farebrother’s induction
to the living clearly was.</p>
<p>This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of
deceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely
his mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you
happen to disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our
theories does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our
egoism is satisfied, the more robust is our belief.</p>
<p>However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr.
Bulstrode, hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter
Featherstone, had become the proprietor of Stone Court, and what
Peter would say “if he were worthy to know,” had become an
inexhaustible and consolatory subject of conversation to his
disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned on that dear
brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of his cunning
by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of delight
to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof that
it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the
genuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats
said, “Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so
pleased with the almshouses after all.”</p>
<p>Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the
advantage which her husband’s health was likely to get from the
purchase of Stone Court. Few days passed without his riding thither
and looking over some part of the farm with the bailiff, and the
evenings were delicious in that quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks
lately set up were sending forth odors to mingle with the breath of
the rich old garden. One evening, while the sun was still above the
horizon and burning in golden lamps among the great walnut boughs,
Mr. Bulstrode was pausing on horseback outside the front gate
waiting for Caleb Garth, who had met him by appointment to give an
opinion on a question of stable drainage, and was now advising the
bailiff in the rick-yard.</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame
and more than usually serene, under the influence of his innocent
recreation. He was doctrinally convinced that there was a total
absence of merit in himself; but that doctrinal conviction may be
held without pain when the sense of demerit does not take a
distinct shape in memory and revive the tingling of shame or the
pang of remorse. Nay, it may be held with intense satisfaction when
the depth of our sinning is but a measure for the depth of
forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are peculiar instruments
of the divine intention. The memory has as many moods as the
temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this moment Mr.
Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of far-off
evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out preaching
beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service of
exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was
his own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was
interrupted by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on
horseback, and was just shaking his bridle before starting, when he
exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the
lane? He’s like one of those men one sees about after the
races.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but
made no reply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles,
whose appearance presented no other change than such as was due to
a suit of black and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of
the horseman now, and they could see the flash of recognition in
his face as he whirled his stick upward, looking all the while at
Mr. Bulstrode, and at last exclaiming:—</p>
<p>“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the
five-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are
you, eh? you didn’t expect to see <i>me</i> here. Come, shake us by
the hand." To say that Mr. Raffles' manner was rather excited would
be only one mode of saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could
see that there was a moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr.
Bulstrode, but it ended in his putting out his hand coldly to
Raffles and saying—</p>
<p>“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country
place.”</p>
<p>“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting
himself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before.
I’m not so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up
a letter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly
fortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my
stepson: he’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To
tell the truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your
address, for—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his
pocket.</p>
<p>Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to
linger on the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man
whose acquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the
banker’s life so unlike anything that was known of him in
Middlemarch that they must have the nature of a secret to pique
curiosity. But Caleb was peculiar: certain human tendencies which
are commonly strong were almost absent from his mind; and one of
these was curiosity about personal affairs. Especially if there was
anything discreditable to be found out concerning another man,
Caleb preferred not to know it; and if he had to tell anybody under
him that his evil doings were discovered, he was more embarrassed
than the culprit. He now spurred his horse, and saying, “I wish you
good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must be getting home,” set off at a
trot.</p>
<p>“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles
continued. “That was not like the first-rate man of business you
used to be. ’The Shrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at
hand, eh?—have cut the London concern altogether—perhaps turned
country squire—have a rural mansion to invite me to. Lord, how many
years it is ago! The old lady must have been dead a pretty long
while—gone to glory without the pain of knowing how poor her
daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very pale and pasty, Nick.
Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your side.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost
deathly hue. Five minutes before, the expanse of his life had been
submerged in its evening sunshine which shone backward to its
remembered morning: sin seemed to be a question of doctrine and
inward penitence, humiliation an exercise of the closet, the
bearing of his deeds a matter of private vision adjusted solely by
spiritual relations and conceptions of the divine purposes. And
now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red figure had risen
before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate past which had
not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But Mr.
Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak
rashly.</p>
<p>“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little.
And you can, if you please, rest here.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now
about seeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”</p>
<p>“Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no
longer. I am master here now.”</p>
<p>Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise,
before he said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough
walking from the coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider
either. What I like is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was
always a little heavy in the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it
must be to you to see me, old fellow!” he continued, as they turned
towards the house. “You don’t say so; but you never took your luck
heartily—you were always thinking of improving the occasion—you’d
such a gift for improving your luck.”</p>
<p>Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and Swung his
leg in a swaggering manner which was rather too much for his
companion’s judicious patience.</p>
<p>“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill
anger, “our acquaintance many years ago had not the sort of
intimacy which you are now assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you
desire of me will be the more readily rendered if you will avoid a
tone of familiarity which did not lie in our former intercourse,
and can hardly be warranted by more than twenty years of
separation.”</p>
<p>“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick
in my heart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my
feelings have ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve
got some in the house now. Josh filled my flask well the last
time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for
cognac was not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and
that a hint of annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it
was at least clear that further objection was useless, and Mr.
Bulstrode, in giving orders to the housekeeper for the
accommodation of the guest, had a resolute air of quietude.</p>
<p>There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been
in the service of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr.
Bulstrode entertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former
master.</p>
<p>When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the
wainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode
said—</p>
<p>“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can
hardly enjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us
will therefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that
you wished to meet me, you probably considered that you had some
business to transact with me. But under the circumstances I will
invite you to remain here for the night, and I will myself ride
over here early to-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact, when I
can receive any Communication you have to make to me.”</p>
<p>“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable
place—a little dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for
a night, with this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again
in the morning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but
Josh owed me a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between
you and me there was never anything but kindness.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and
sneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink,
had determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more
words upon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of
the difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be
permanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he
should wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance
could not be regarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit
of evil might have sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion
as an instrument of good; but the threat must have been permitted,
and was a chastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for
him very different from the hours in which his struggle had been
securely private, and which had ended with a sense that his secret
misdeeds were pardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds
even when committed—had they not been half sanctified by the
singleness of his desire to devote himself and all he possessed to
the furtherance of the divine scheme? And was he after all to
become a mere stone of stumbling and a rock of offence? For who
would understand the work within him? Who would not, when there was
the pretext of casting disgrace upon him, confound his whole life
and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of obloquy?</p>
<p>In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr.
Bulstrode’s mind clad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal
references to superhuman ends. But even while we are talking and
meditating about the earth’s orbit and the solar system, what we
feel and adjust our movements to is the stable earth and the
changing day. And now within all the automatic succession of
theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and the ache of
oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was the
forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his
own wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,
depends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim
at escaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is
disgrace. But Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent
Christian.</p>
<p>It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he
again reached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more
like a delightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies
were in flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered
with dew, were running away over the low stone wall; the very
noises all around had a heart of peace within them. But everything
was spoiled for the owner as he walked on the gravel in front and
awaited the descent of Mr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to
breakfast.</p>
<p>It was not long before they were seated together in the
wainscoted parlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as
Raffles cared to take at that early hour. The difference between
his morning and evening self was not so great as his companion had
imagined that it might be; the delight in tormenting was perhaps
even the stronger because his spirits were rather less highly
pitched. Certainly his manners seemed more disagreeable by the
morning light.</p>
<p>“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker,
who could hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast
without eating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once
the ground on which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you
have a home elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”</p>
<p>“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old
friend, Nick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young
Nick when we knew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you
had a handsome family likeness to old Nick, but that was your
mother’s fault, calling you Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me
again? I expected an invite to stay with you at some pretty place.
My own establishment is broken up now my wife’s dead. I’ve no
particular attachment to any spot; I would as soon settle hereabout
as anywhere.”</p>
<p>“May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the
strong wish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was
furnished, was tantamount to an engagement that you would remain
there for life.”</p>
<p>“Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a
wish to stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit
me to stay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr.
Raffles winked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.</p>
<p>“Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling
now?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I
don’t care about working any more. If I did anything it would be a
little travelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort,
which takes a man into agreeable company. But not without an
independence to fall back upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so
strong as I was, Nick, though I’ve got more color than you. I want
an independence.”</p>
<p>“That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a
distance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much
eagerness in his undertone.</p>
<p>“That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly.
“I see no reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances
hereabout. I’m not ashamed of myself as company for anybody. I
dropped my portmanteau at the turnpike when I got down—change of
linen—genuine—honor bright—more than fronts and wristbands; and
with this suit of mourning, straps and everything, I should do you
credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles had pushed away his chair
and looked down at himself, particularly at his straps. His chief
intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really thought that his
appearance now would produce a good effect, and that he was not
only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which implied
solid connections.</p>
<p>“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said
Bulstrode, after a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my
wishes.”</p>
<p>“Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality.
“Didn’t I always do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me,
and I got but little. I’ve often thought since, I might have done
better by telling the old woman that I’d found her daughter and her
grandchild: it would have suited my feelings better; I’ve got a
soft place in my heart. But you’ve buried the old lady by this
time, I suppose—it’s all one to her now. And you’ve got your
fortune out of that profitable business which had such a blessing
on it. You’ve taken to being a nob, buying land, being a country
bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still godly? Or taken to
the Church as more genteel?”</p>
<p>This time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his
tongue was worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude
that it was not a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode
felt a shuddering nausea, and did not speak, but was considering
diligently whether he should not leave Raffles to do as he would,
and simply defy him as a slanderer. The man would soon show himself
disreputable enough to make people disbelieve him. “But not when he
tells any ugly-looking truth about <i>you</i>," said discerning
consciousness. And again: it seemed no wrong to keep Raffles at a
distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the direct falsehood of
denying true statements. It was one thing to look back on forgiven
sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax customs, and
another to enter deliberately on the necessity of falsehood.</p>
<p>But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of
using time to the utmost.</p>
<p>“I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went
confoundedly with me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and
a man of gentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married
when I came back—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of
me—but the trade was restricted, as we say. She had been settled
there a good many years by a friend; but there was a son too much
in the case. Josh and I never hit it off. However, I made the most
of the position, and I’ve always taken my glass in good company.
It’s been all on the square with me; I’m as open as the day. You
won’t take it ill of me that I didn’t look you up before. I’ve got
a complaint that makes me a little dilatory. I thought you were
trading and praying away in London still, and didn’t find you
there. But you see I was sent to you, Nick—perhaps for a blessing
to both of us.”</p>
<p>Mr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: no man felt his
intellect more superior to religious cant. And if the cunning which
calculates on the meanest feelings in men could be, called
intellect, he had his share, for under the blurting rallying tone
with which he spoke to Bulstrode, there was an evident selection of
statements, as if they had been so many moves at chess. Meanwhile
Bulstrode had determined on his move, and he said, with gathered
resolution—</p>
<p>“You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible
for a man to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue
advantage. Although I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing
to supply you with a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long
as you fulfil a promise to remain at a distance from this
neighborhood. It is in your power to choose. If you insist on
remaining here, even for a short time, you will get nothing from
me. I shall decline to know you.”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha!” said Raffles, with an affected explosion, “that
reminds me of a droll dog of a thief who declined to know the
constable.”</p>
<p>“Your allusions are lost on me sir,” said Bulstrode, with white
heat; “the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any
other.”</p>
<p>“You can’t understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that
I should never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your
quarterly payment won’t quite suit me. I like my freedom.”</p>
<p>Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the
room, swinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation.
At last he stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you
what! Give us a couple of hundreds—come, that’s modest—and I’ll go
away—honor bright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall
not give up my Liberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go
where I like. Perhaps it may suit me to stay away, and correspond
with a friend; perhaps not. Have you the money with you?”</p>
<p>“No, I have one hundred,” said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate
riddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future
uncertainties. “I will forward you the other if you will mention an
address.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll wait here till you bring it,” said Raffles. “I’ll take
a stroll and have a snack, and you’ll be back by that time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bulstrode’s sickly body, shattered by the agitations he had
gone through since the last evening, made him feel abjectly in the
power of this loud invulnerable man. At that moment he snatched at
a temporary repose to be won on any terms. He was rising to do what
Raffles suggested, when the latter said, lifting up his finger as
if with a sudden recollection—</p>
<p>“I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell
you; I’d a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I
didn’t find her, but I found out her husband’s name, and I made a
note of it. But hang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard
it, I should know it again. I’ve got my faculties as if I was in my
prime, but names wear out, by Jove! Sometimes I’m no better than a
confounded tax-paper before the names are filled in. However, if I
hear of her and her family, you shall know, Nick. You’d like to do
something for her, now she’s your step-daughter.”</p>
<p>“Doubtless,“ said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of
his light-gray eyes; ”though that might reduce my power of
assisting you.“</p>
<p>As he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back,
and then turned towards the window to watch the banker riding
away—virtually at his command. His lips first curled with a smile
and then opened with a short triumphant laugh.</p>
<p>“But what the deuce was the name?” he presently said, half
aloud, scratching his head, and wrinkling his brows horizontally.
He had not really cared or thought about this point of
forgetfulness until it occurred to him in his invention of
annoyances for Bulstrode.</p>
<p>“It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on,
with a sense that he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the
hold was too slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase;
for few men were more impatient of private occupation or more in
need of making themselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles. He
preferred using his time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff
and the housekeeper, from whom he gathered as much as he wanted to
know about Mr. Bulstrode’s position in Middlemarch.</p>
<p>After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed
relieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated
alone with these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly
slapped his knee, and exclaimed, “Ladislaw!“ That action of memory
which he had tried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had
suddenly completed itself without conscious effort—a common
experience, agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name
remembered is of no value. Raffles immediately took out his
pocket-book, and wrote down the name, not because he expected to
use it, but merely for the sake of not being at a loss if he ever
did happen to want it. He was not going to tell Bulstrode: there
was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like that of Mr.
Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.</p>
<p>He was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock
that day he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and
mounted the coach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode’s eyes of an ugly black
spot on the landscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the
dread that the black spot might reappear and become inseparable
even from the vision of his hearth.</p>
