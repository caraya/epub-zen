<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">“I</span> wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this," said
Sir James Chettam, with a little frown on his brow, and an
expression of intense disgust about his mouth.</p>
<p>He was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick
Grange, and speaking to Mr. Brooke. It was the day after Mr.
Casaubon had been buried, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave
her room.</p>
<p>“That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she is an
executrix, and she likes to go into these things—property, land,
that kind of thing. She has her notions, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke, sticking his eye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the
edges of a folded paper which he held in his hand; “and she would
like to act—depend upon it, as an executrix Dorothea would want to
act. And she was twenty-one last December, you know. I can hinder
nothing.”</p>
<p>Sir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence, and then
lifting his eyes suddenly fixed them on Mr. Brooke, saying, “I will
tell you what we can do. Until Dorothea is well, all business must
be kept from her, and as soon as she is able to be moved she must
come to us. Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in
the world for her, and will pass away the time. And meanwhile you
must get rid of Ladislaw: you must send him out of the country.”
Here Sir James’s look of disgust returned in all its intensity.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke put his hands behind him, walked to the window and
straightened his back with a little shake before he replied.</p>
<p>“That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.”</p>
<p>“My dear sir,” persisted Sir James, restraining his indignation
within respectful forms, “it was you who brought him here, and you
who keep him here—I mean by the occupation you give him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I can’t dismiss him in an instant without assigning
reasons, my dear Chettam. Ladislaw has been invaluable, most
satisfactory. I consider that I have done this part of the country
a service by bringing him—by bringing him, you know.” Mr. Brooke
ended with a nod, turning round to give it.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity this part of the country didn’t do without him,
that’s all I have to say about it. At any rate, as Dorothea’s
brother-in-law, I feel warranted in objecting strongly to his being
kept here by any action on the part of her friends. You admit, I
hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity
of my wife’s sister?”</p>
<p>Sir James was getting warm.</p>
<p>“Of course, my dear Chettam, of course. But you and I have
different ideas—different—”</p>
<p>“Not about this action of Casaubon’s, I should hope,”
interrupted Sir James. “I say that he has most unfairly compromised
Dorothea. I say that there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly
action than this—a codicil of this sort to a will which he made at
the time of his marriage with the knowledge and reliance of her
family—a positive insult to Dorothea!”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw.
Ladislaw has told me the reason—dislike of the bent he took, you
know—Ladislaw didn’t think much of Casaubon’s notions, Thoth and
Dagon—that sort of thing: and I fancy that Casaubon didn’t like the
independent position Ladislaw had taken up. I saw the letters
between them, you know. Poor Casaubon was a little buried in
books—he didn’t know the world.”</p>
<p>“It’s all very well for Ladislaw to put that color on it,” said
Sir James. “But I believe Casaubon was only jealous of him on
Dorothea’s account, and the world will suppose that she gave him
some reason; and that is what makes it so abominable—coupling her
name with this young fellow’s.”</p>
<p>“My dear Chettam, it won’t lead to anything, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke, seating himself and sticking on his eye-glass again. “It’s
all of a piece with Casaubon’s oddity. This paper, now, ’Synoptical
Tabulation’ and so on, ’for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,’ it was
locked up in the desk with the will. I suppose he meant Dorothea to
publish his researches, eh? and she’ll do it, you know; she has
gone into his studies uncommonly.”</p>
<p>“My dear sir,” said Sir James, impatiently, “that is neither
here nor there. The question is, whether you don’t see with me the
propriety of sending young Ladislaw away?”</p>
<p>“Well, no, not the urgency of the thing. By-and-by, perhaps, it
may come round. As to gossip, you know, sending him away won’t
hinder gossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have
chapter and verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the
truths that lay on the side of his own wishes. “I might get rid of
Ladislaw up to a certain point—take away the ’Pioneer’ from him,
and that sort of thing; but I couldn’t send him out of the country
if he didn’t choose to go—didn’t choose, you know.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing
the nature of last year’s weather, and nodding at the end with his
usual amenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.</p>
<p>“Good God!” said Sir James, with as much passion as he ever
showed, “let us get him a post; let us spend money on him. If he
could go in the suite of some Colonial Governor! Grampus might take
him—and I could write to Fulke about it.”</p>
<p>“But Ladislaw won’t be shipped off like a head of cattle, my
dear fellow; Ladislaw has his ideas. It’s my opinion that if he
were to part from me to-morrow, you’d only hear the more of him in
the country. With his talent for speaking and drawing up documents,
there are few men who could come up to him as an agitator—an
agitator, you know.”</p>
<p>“Agitator!“ said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that
the syllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient
exposure of its hatefulness.</p>
<p>“But be reasonable, Chettam. Dorothea, now. As you say, she had
better go to Celia as soon as possible. She can stay under your
roof, and in the mean time things may come round quietly. Don’t let
us be firing off our guns in a hurry, you know. Standish will keep
our counsel, and the news will be old before it’s known. Twenty
things may happen to carry off Ladislaw—without my doing anything,
you know.”</p>
<p>“Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?”</p>
<p>“Decline, Chettam?—no—I didn’t say decline. But I really don’t
see what I could do. Ladislaw is a gentleman.”</p>
<p>“I am glad to hear It!” said Sir James, his irritation making
him forget himself a little. “I am sure Casaubon was not.”</p>
<p>“Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to
hinder her from marrying again at all, you know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that,” said Sir James. “It would have been less
indelicate.”</p>
<p>“One of poor Casaubon’s freaks! That attack upset his brain a
little. It all goes for nothing. She doesn’t <i>want</i> to marry
Ladislaw."</p>
<p>“But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that
she did. I don’t believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,” said
Sir James—then frowningly, “but I suspect Ladislaw. I tell you
frankly, I suspect Ladislaw.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam.
In fact, if it were possible to pack him off—send him to Norfolk
Island—that sort of thing—it would look all the worse for Dorothea
to those who knew about it. It would seem as if we distrusted
her—distrusted her, you know.”</p>
<p>That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend
to soothe Sir James. He put out his hand to reach his hat, implying
that he did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some
heat—</p>
<p>“Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,
because her friends were too careless. I shall do what I can, as
her brother, to protect her now.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do better than get her to Freshitt as soon as
possible, Chettam. I approve that plan altogether,” said Mr.
Brooke, well pleased that he had won the argument. It would have
been highly inconvenient to him to part with Ladislaw at that time,
when a dissolution might happen any day, and electors were to be
convinced of the course by which the interests of the country would
be best served. Mr. Brooke sincerely believed that this end could
be secured by his own return to Parliament: he offered the forces
of his mind honestly to the nation.</p>
