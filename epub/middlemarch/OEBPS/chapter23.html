<blockquote><p>
          “Your horses of the Sun,” he said, <br/>
          "And first-rate whip Apollo!<br/>
          Whate'er they be, I'll eat my head,<br/>
          But I will beat them hollow."<br/>
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">F</span>red Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on his mind, and though no
such immaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young
gentleman for many hours together, there were circumstances
connected with this debt which made the thought of it unusually
importunate. The creditor was Mr. Bambridge a horse-dealer of the
neighborhood, whose company was much sought in Middlemarch by young
men understood to be "addicted to pleasure." During the vacations
Fred had naturally required more amusements than he had ready money
for, and Mr. Bambridge had been accommodating enough not only to
trust him for the hire of horses and the accidental expense of
ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a small advance by which he
might be able to meet some losses at billiards. The total debt was
a hundred and sixty pounds. Bambridge was in no alarm about his
money, being sure that young Vincy had backers; but he had required
something to show for it, and Fred had at first given a bill with
his own signature. Three months later he had renewed this bill with
the signature of Caleb Garth. On both occasions Fred had felt
confident that he should meet the bill himself, having ample funds
at disposal in his own hopefulness. You will hardly demand that his
confidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence,
we know, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a
comfortable disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of
providence or the folly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or
the still greater mystery of our high individual value in the
universe, will bring about agreeable issues, such as are consistent
with our good taste in costume, and our general preference for the
best style of thing. Fred felt sure that he should have a present
from his uncle, that he should have a run of luck, that by dint of
"swapping" he should gradually metamorphose a horse worth forty
pounds into a horse that would fetch a hundred at any
moment—"judgment" being always equivalent to an unspecified sum in
hard cash. And in any case, even supposing negations which only a
morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that time) his
father's pocket as a last resource, so that his assets of
hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them. Of what
might be the capacity of his father's pocket, Fred had only a vague
notion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of
one year be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived
in an easy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according
to the family habits and traditions, so that the children had no
standard of economy, and the elder ones retained some of their
infantine notion that their father might pay for anything if he
would. Mr. Vincy himself had expensive Middlemarch habits—spent
money on coursing, on his cellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma
had those running accounts with tradespeople, which give a cheerful
sense of getting everything one wants without any question of
payment. But it was in the nature of fathers, Fred knew, to bully
one about expenses: there was always a little storm over his
extravagance if he had to disclose a debt, and Fred disliked bad
weather within doors. He was too filial to be disrespectful to his
father, and he bore the thunder with the certainty that it was
transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see his
mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having
fun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he looked glum under
scolding, it was chiefly for propriety's sake. The easier course
plainly, was to renew the bill with a friend's signature. Why not?
With the superfluous securities of hope at his command, there was
no reason why he should not have increased other people's
liabilities to any extent, but for the fact that men whose names
were good for anything were usually pessimists, indisposed to
believe that the universal order of things would necessarily be
agreeable to an agreeable young gentleman.</p>
<p>With a favor to ask we review our list of friends, do justice to
their more amiable qualities, forgive their little offenses, and
concerning each in turn, try to arrive at the conclusion that he
will be eager to oblige us, our own eagerness to be obliged being
as communicable as other warmth. Still there is always a certain
number who are dismissed as but moderately eager until the others
have refused; and it happened that Fred checked off all his friends
but one, on the ground that applying to them would be disagreeable;
being implicitly convinced that he at least (whatever might be
maintained about mankind generally) had a right to be free from
anything disagreeable. That he should ever fall into a thoroughly
unpleasant position—wear trousers shrunk with washing, eat cold
mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to “duck under” in any
sort of way—was an absurdity irreconcilable with those cheerful
intuitions implanted in him by nature. And Fred winced under the
idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts.
Thus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was
at once the poorest and the kindest—namely, Caleb Garth.</p>
<p>The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when
he and Rosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off,
the slight connection between the two families through Mr.
Featherstone’s double marriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister,
and the second to Mrs. Vincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which
was carried on between the children rather than the parents: the
children drank tea together out of their toy teacups, and spent
whole days together in play. Mary was a little hoyden, and Fred at
six years old thought her the nicest girl in the world making her
his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from an umbrella.
Through all the stages of his education he had kept his affection
for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a second
home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his
family had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the
Vincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife, for there
were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old
manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none
but equals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority
which was defined with great nicety in practice, though hardly
expressible theoretically. Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the
building business, which he had unfortunately added to his other
avocations of surveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that
business for a time entirely for the benefit of his assignees, and
had been living narrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he
might after all pay twenty shillings in the pound. He had now
achieved this, and from all who did not think it a bad precedent,
his honorable exertions had won him due esteem; but in no part of
the world is genteel visiting founded on esteem, in the absence of
suitable furniture and complete dinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had
never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth, and frequently spoke of her
as a woman who had had to work for her bread—meaning that Mrs.
Garth had been a teacher before her marriage; in which case an
intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions was something
like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a courier’s
acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better off
needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr.
Featherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths
had been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred
should engage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in
such a small way.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home
of his visits to Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more
frequent, the increasing ardor of his affection for Mary inclining
him the more towards those who belonged to her.</p>
<p>Mr. Garth had a small office in the town, and to this Fred went
with his request. He obtained it without much difficulty, for a
large amount of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb
Garth cautious about his own affairs, or distrustful of his
fellow-men when they had not proved themselves untrustworthy; and
he had the highest opinion of Fred, was “sure the lad would turn
out well—an open affectionate fellow, with a good bottom to his
character—you might trust him for anything.” Such was Caleb’s
psychological argument. He was one of those rare men who are rigid
to themselves and indulgent to others. He had a certain shame about
his neighbors’ errors, and never spoke of them willingly; hence he
was not likely to divert his mind from the best mode of hardening
timber and other ingenious devices in order to preconceive those
errors. If he had to blame any one, it was necessary for him to
move all the papers within his reach, or describe various diagrams
with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his
pocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s
work than find fault with their doing. I fear he was a bad
disciplinarian.</p>
<p>When Fred stated the circumstances of his debt, his wish to meet
it without troubling his father, and the certainty that the money
would be forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb
pushed his spectacles upward, listened, looked into his favorite’s
clear young eyes, and believed him, not distinguishing confidence
about the future from veracity about the past; but he felt that it
was an occasion for a friendly hint as to conduct, and that before
giving his signature he must give a rather strong admonition.
Accordingly, he took the paper and lowered his spectacles, measured
the space at his command, reached his pen and examined it, dipped
it in the ink and examined it again, then pushed the paper a little
way from him, lifted up his spectacles again, showed a deepened
depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows, which gave his
face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details for once—you would
have learned to love them if you had known Caleb Garth), and said
in a comfortable tone—</p>
<p>“It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees? And
then, these exchanges, they don’t answer when you have ’cute
jockeys to deal with. You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”</p>
<p>Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write
his signature with the care which he always gave to that
performance; for whatever he did in the way of business he did
well. He contemplated the large well-proportioned letters and final
flourish, with his head a trifle on one side for an instant, then
handed it to Fred, said “Good-by,“ and returned forthwith to his
absorption in a plan for Sir James Chettam’s new
farm-buildings.</p>
<p>Either because his interest in this work thrust the incident of
the signature from his memory, or for some reason of which Caleb
was more conscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair.</p>
<p>Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred’s sky, which
altered his view of the distance, and was the reason why his uncle
Featherstone’s present of money was of importance enough to make
his color come and go, first with a too definite expectation, and
afterwards with a proportionate disappointment. His failure in
passing his examination, had made his accumulation of college debts
the more unpardonable by his father, and there had been an
unprecedented storm at home. Mr. Vincy had sworn that if he had
anything more of that sort to put up with, Fred should turn out and
get his living how he could; and he had never yet quite recovered
his good-humored tone to his son, who had especially enraged him by
saying at this stage of things that he did not want to be a
clergyman, and would rather not “go on with that.” Fred was
conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with if
his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr.
Featherstone’s heir; that old gentleman’s pride in him, and
apparent fondness for him, serving in the stead of more exemplary
conduct—just as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call
the act kleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and
never think of his being sent to the house of correction as if he
were a ragged boy who had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit
expectations of what would be done for him by uncle Featherstone
determined the angle at which most people viewed Fred Vincy in
Middlemarch; and in his own consciousness, what uncle Featherstone
would do for him in an emergency, or what he would do simply as an
incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable depth of aerial
perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once made, was
measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a
deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred’s “judgment“
or by luck in some other shape. For that little episode of the
alleged borrowing, in which he had made his father the agent in
getting the Bulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going
to his father for money towards meeting his actual debt. Fred was
keen enough to foresee that anger would confuse distinctions, and
that his denial of having borrowed expressly on the strength of his
uncle’s will would be taken as a falsehood. He had gone to his
father and told him one vexatious affair, and he had left another
untold: in such cases the complete revelation always produces the
impression of a previous duplicity. Now Fred piqued himself on
keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; he often shrugged his
shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called
Rosamond’s fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas
with a lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of
falsehood he would even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It
was under strong inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken
the wise step of depositing the eighty pounds with his mother. It
was a pity that he had not at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he
meant to make the sum complete with another sixty, and with a view
to this, he had kept twenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of
seed-corn, which, planted by judgment, and watered by luck, might
yield more than threefold—a very poor rate of multiplication when
the field is a young gentleman’s infinite soul, with all the
numerals at command.</p>
<p>Fred was not a gambler: he had not that specific disease in
which the suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or
risk becomes as necessary as the dram to the drunkard; he had only
the tendency to that diffusive form of gambling which has no
alcoholic intensity, but is carried on with the healthiest
chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous imaginative activity which
fashions events according to desire, and having no fears about its
own weather, only sees the advantage there must be to others in
going aboard with it. Hopefulness has a pleasure in making a throw
of any kind, because the prospect of success is certain; and only a
more generous pleasure in offering as many as possible a share in
the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards, as he liked
hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he only liked it the better
because he wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty pounds’
worth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green
plot—all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the
roadside—and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with
no money at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited
with his mother. The broken-winded horse which he rode represented
a present which had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle
Featherstone: his father always allowed him to keep a horse, Mr.
Vincy’s own habits making him regard this as a reasonable demand
even for a son who was rather exasperating. This horse, then, was
Fred’s property, and in his anxiety to meet the imminent bill he
determined to sacrifice a possession without which life would
certainly be worth little. He made the resolution with a sense of
heroism—heroism forced on him by the dread of breaking his word to
Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe of her opinion. He would
start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be held the next
morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the money by
coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty pounds,
and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly to
balk himself of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to one that some
good chance would fall in his way; the longer he thought of it, the
less possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance, and
the less reasonable that he should not equip himself with the
powder and shot for bringing it down. He would ride to Houndsley
with Bambridge and with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them
anything expressly, he should virtually get the benefit of their
opinion. Before he set out, Fred got the eighty pounds from his
mother.</p>
<p>Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company
with Bambridge and Horrock, on his way of course to Houndsley
horse-fair, thought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual;
and but for an unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he
himself would have had a sense of dissipation, and of doing what
might be expected of a gay young fellow. Considering that Fred was
not at all coarse, that he rather looked down on the manners and
speech of young men who had not been to the university, and that he
had written stanzas as pastoral and unvoluptuous as his
flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and Horrock was an
interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh would not
wholly account for without that mysterious influence of Naming
which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other name
than “pleasure“ the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock must
certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with them
at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion
in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished
with a dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an
anonymous horse in a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with
legs and cravat, and various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a
hard business, but for the sustaining power of nomenclature which
determined that the pursuit of these things was ”gay.”</p>
<p>In Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness
which offered play to the imagination. Costume, at a glance, gave
him a thrilling association with horses (enough to specify the
hat-brim which took the slightest upward angle just to escape the
suspicion of bending downwards), and nature had given him a face
which by dint of Mongolian eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin
seeming to follow his hat-brim in a moderate inclination upwards,
gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile, of all
expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind, and, when
accompanied by adequate silence, likely to create the reputation of
an invincible understanding, an infinite fund of humor—too dry to
flow, and probably in a state of immovable crust,—and a critical
judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it,
would be <i>the</i> thing and no other. It is a physiognomy seen in
all vocations, but perhaps it has never been more powerful over the
youth of England than in a judge of horses.</p>
<p>Mr. Horrock, at a question from Fred about his horse’s fetlock,
turned sideways in his saddle, and watched the horse’s action for
the space of three minutes, then turned forward, twitched his own
bridle, and remained silent with a profile neither more nor less
sceptical than it had been.</p>
<p>The part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly
effective. A mixture of passions was excited in Fred—a mad desire
to thrash Horrock’s opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety
to retain the advantage of his friendship. There was always the
chance that Horrock might say something quite invaluable at the
right moment.</p>
<p>Mr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth
his ideas without economy. He was loud, robust, and was sometimes
spoken of as being “given to indulgence”—chiefly in swearing,
drinking, and beating his wife. Some people who had lost by him
called him a vicious man; but he regarded horse-dealing as the
finest of the arts, and might have argued plausibly that it had
nothing to do with morality. He was undeniably a prosperous man,
bore his drinking better than others bore their moderation, and, on
the whole, flourished like the green bay-tree. But his range of
conversation was limited, and like the fine old tune, “Drops of
brandy,” gave you after a while a sense of returning upon itself in
a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a slight infusion of
Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to several
circles in Middlemarch; and he was a distinguished figure in the
bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. He knew some anecdotes
about the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of
Marquesses and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted
its pre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute
retentiveness of his memory was chiefly shown about the horses he
had himself bought and sold; the number of miles they would trot
you in no time without turning a hair being, after the lapse of
years, still a subject of passionate asseveration, in which he
would assist the imagination of his hearers by solemnly swearing
that they never saw anything like it. In short, Mr. Bambridge was a
man of pleasure and a gay companion.</p>
<p>Fred was subtle, and did not tell his friends that he was going
to Houndsley bent on selling his horse: he wished to get indirectly
at their genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a
genuine opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such
eminent critics. It was not Mr. Bambridge’s weakness to be a
gratuitous flatterer. He had never before been so much struck with
the fact that this unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which
required the roundest word for perdition to give you any idea of
it.</p>
<p>“You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but
me, Vincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than
that chestnut, and you gave him for this brute. If you set him
cantering, he goes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one
worse roarer in my life, and that was a roan: it belonged to
Pegwell, the corn-factor; he used to drive him in his gig seven
years ago, and he wanted me to take him, but I said, ’Thank you,
Peg, I don’t deal in wind-instruments.’ That was what I said. It
went the round of the country, that joke did. But, what the hell!
the horse was a penny trumpet to that roarer of yours.”</p>
<p>“Why, you said just now his was worse than mine,” said Fred,
more irritable than usual.</p>
<p>“I said a lie, then,” said Mr. Bambridge, emphatically. “There
wasn’t a penny to choose between ’em.”</p>
<p>Fred spurred his horse, and they trotted on a little way. When
they slackened again, Mr. Bambridge said—</p>
<p>“Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.”</p>
<p>“I’m quite satisfied with his paces, I know,” said Fred, who
required all the consciousness of being in gay company to support
him; “I say his trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?”</p>
<p>Mr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as
if he had been a portrait by a great master.</p>
<p>Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion;
but on reflection he saw that Bambridge’s depreciation and
Horrock’s silence were both virtually encouraging, and indicated
that they thought better of the horse than they chose to say.</p>
<p>That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred
thought he saw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of
his horse, but an opening which made him congratulate himself on
his foresight in bringing with him his eighty pounds. A young
farmer, acquainted with Mr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and
entered into conversation about parting with a hunter, which he
introduced at once as Diamond, implying that it was a public
character. For himself he only wanted a useful hack, which would
draw upon occasion; being about to marry and to give up hunting.
The hunter was in a friend’s stable at some little distance; there
was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark. The friend’s
stable had to be reached through a back street where you might as
easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim
street of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against
disgust by brandy, as his companions were, but the hope of having
at last seen the horse that would enable him to make money was
exhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the
first thing in the morning. He felt sure that if he did not come to
a bargain with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of
circumstances, Fred felt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing
him with all the constructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run
down Diamond in a way that he never would have done (the horse
being a friend’s) if he had not thought of buying it; every one who
looked at the animal—even Horrock—was evidently impressed with its
merit. To get all the advantage of being with men of this sort, you
must know how to draw your inferences, and not be a spoon who takes
things literally. The color of the horse was a dappled gray, and
Fred happened to know that Lord Medlicote’s man was on the look-out
for just such a horse. After all his running down, Bambridge let it
out in the course of the evening, when the farmer was absent, that
he had seen worse horses go for eighty pounds. Of course he
contradicted himself twenty times over, but when you know what is
likely to be true you can test a man’s admissions. And Fred could
not but reckon his own judgment of a horse as worth something. The
farmer had paused over Fred’s respectable though broken-winded
steed long enough to show that he thought it worth consideration,
and it seemed probable that he would take it, with five-and-twenty
pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In that case
Fred, when he had parted with his new horse for at least eighty
pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction,
and would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the
bill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at
the utmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time he was hurrying on
his clothes in the morning, he saw so clearly the importance of not
losing this rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both
dissuaded him, he would not have been deluded into a direct
interpretation of their purpose: he would have been aware that
those deep hands held something else than a young fellow’s
interest. With regard to horses, distrust was your only clew. But
scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly applied, else life
would come to a standstill: something we must believe in and do,
and whatever that something may be called, it is virtually our own
judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish reliance on
another. Fred believed in the excellence of his bargain, and even
before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the dappled
gray, at the price of his old horse and thirty pounds in
addition—only five pounds more than he had expected to give.</p>
<p>But he felt a little worried and wearied, perhaps with mental
debate, and without waiting for the further gayeties of the
horse-fair, he set out alone on his fourteen miles’ journey,
meaning to take it very quietly and keep his horse fresh.</p>
