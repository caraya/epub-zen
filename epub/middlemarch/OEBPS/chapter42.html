<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">O</span>ne of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his
return from his wedding-journey was to Lowick Manor, in consequence
of a letter which had requested him to fix a time for his
visit.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of
his illness to Lydgate, nor had he even to Dorothea betrayed any
anxiety as to how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or
his life. On this point, as on all others, he shrank from pity; and
if the suspicion of being pitied for anything in his lot surmised
or known in spite of himself was embittering, the idea of calling
forth a show of compassion by frankly admitting an alarm or a
sorrow was necessarily intolerable to him. Every proud mind knows
something of this experience, and perhaps it is only to be overcome
by a sense of fellowship deep enough to make all efforts at
isolation seem mean and petty instead of exalting.</p>
<p>But Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which
the question of his health and life haunted his silence with a more
harassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of
his authorship. It is true that this last might be called his
central ambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which
by far the largest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated
in the consciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few
streaks amid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was
the way with Mr. Casaubon’s hard intellectual labors. Their most
characteristic result was not the “Key to all Mythologies,” but a
morbid consciousness that others did not give him the place which
he had not demonstrably merited—a perpetual suspicious conjecture
that the views entertained of him were not to his advantage—a
melancholy absence of passion in his efforts at achievement, and a
passionate resistance to the confession that he had achieved
nothing.</p>
<p>Thus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have
absorbed and dried him, was really no security against wounds,
least of all against those which came from Dorothea. And he had
begun now to frame possibilities for the future which were somehow
more embittering to him than anything his mind had dwelt on
before.</p>
<p>Against certain facts he was helpless: against Will Ladislaw’s
existence, his defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick, and his
flippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic,
well-stamped erudition: against Dorothea’s nature, always taking on
some new shape of ardent activity, and even in submission and
silence covering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think
of: against certain notions and likings which had taken possession
of her mind in relation to subjects that he could not possibly
discuss with her. There was no denying that Dorothea was as
virtuous and lovely a young lady as he could have obtained for a
wife; but a young lady turned out to be something more troublesome
than he had conceived. She nursed him, she read to him, she
anticipated his wants, and was solicitous about his feelings; but
there had entered into the husband’s mind the certainty that she
judged him, and that her wifely devotedness was like a penitential
expiation of unbelieving thoughts—was accompanied with a power of
comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too luminously
as a part of things in general. His discontent passed vapor-like
through all her gentle loving manifestations, and clung to that
inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Casaubon! This suffering was the harder to bear because
it seemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped
him with perfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife;
and early instances of criticism and resentment had made an
impression which no tenderness and submission afterwards could
remove. To his suspicious interpretation Dorothea’s silence now was
a suppressed rebellion; a remark from her which he had not in any
way anticipated was an assertion of conscious superiority; her
gentle answers had an irritating cautiousness in them; and when she
acquiesced it was a self-approved effort of forbearance. The
tenacity with which he strove to hide this inward drama made it the
more vivid for him; as we hear with the more keenness what we wish
others not to hear.</p>
<p>Instead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon, I
think it quite ordinary. Will not a tiny speck very close to our
vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by
which we see the blot? I know no speck so troublesome as self. And
who, if Mr. Casaubon had chosen to expound his discontents—his
suspicions that he was not any longer adored without
criticism—could have denied that they were founded on good reasons?
On the contrary, there was a strong reason to be added, which he
had not himself taken explicitly into account—namely, that he was
not unmixedly adorable. He suspected this, however, as he suspected
other things, without confessing it, and like the rest of us, felt
how soothing it would have been to have a companion who would never
find it out.</p>
<p>This sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly
prepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick, and what had
occurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon’s power of suspicious
construction into exasperated activity. To all the facts which he
knew, he added imaginary facts both present and future which became
more real to him than those because they called up a stronger
dislike, a more predominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of
Will Ladislaw’s intentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea’s
impressions, were constantly at their weaving work. It would be
quite unjust to him to suppose that he could have entered into any
coarse misinterpretation of Dorothea: his own habits of mind and
conduct, quite as much as the open elevation of her nature, saved
him from any such mistake. What he was jealous of was her opinion,
the sway that might be given to her ardent mind in its judgments,
and the future possibilities to which these might lead her. As to
Will, though until his last defiant letter he had nothing definite
which he would choose formally to allege against him, he felt
himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any design
which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined
impulsiveness. He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of
Will’s return from Rome, and his determination to settle in the
neighborhood; and he was penetrating enough to imagine that
Dorothea had innocently encouraged this course. It was as clear as
possible that she was ready to be attached to Will and to be pliant
to his suggestions: they had never had a tete-a-tete without her
bringing away from it some new troublesome impression, and the last
interview that Mr. Casaubon was aware of (Dorothea, on returning
from Freshitt Hall, had for the first time been silent about having
seen Will) had led to a scene which roused an angrier feeling
against them both than he had ever known before. Dorothea’s
outpouring of her notions about money, in the darkness of the
night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more odious
foreboding into her husband’s mind.</p>
<p>And there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly
present with him. He was certainly much revived; he had recovered
all his usual power of work: the illness might have been mere
fatigue, and there might still be twenty years of achievement
before him, which would justify the thirty years of preparation.
That prospect was made the sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against
the hasty sneers of Carp &amp; Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon
was carrying his taper among the tombs of the past, those modern
figures came athwart the dim light, and interrupted his diligent
exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake, so that he would have
to eat his own words with a good deal of indigestion, would be an
agreeable accident of triumphant authorship, which the prospect of
living to future ages on earth and to all eternity in heaven could
not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus, the prevision of his
own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter savors of irritated
jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less surprising that the
probability of a transient earthly bliss for other persons, when he
himself should have entered into glory, had not a potently
sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some undermining
disease was at work within him, there might be large opportunity
for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if one of
those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so
strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his
disembodied existence.</p>
<p>This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of
putting the case. The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr.
Casaubon, we know, had a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride
in satisfying the requirements of honor, which compelled him to
find other reasons for his conduct than those of jealousy and
vindictiveness. The way in which Mr. Casaubon put the case was
this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had to care for her well-being
in case of my death. But well-being is not to be secured by ample,
independent possession of property; on the contrary, occasions
might arise in which such possession might expose her to the more
danger. She is ready prey to any man who knows how to play adroitly
either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic enthusiasm; and a
man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a man with no
other principle than transient caprice, and who has a personal
animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed by
the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly
vented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard
it. Even if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he
may attempt through indirect influence. This man has gained
Dorothea’s ear: he has fascinated her attention; he has evidently
tried to impress her mind with the notion that he has claims beyond
anything I have done for him. If I die—and he is waiting here on
the watch for that—he will persuade her to marry him. That would be
calamity for her and success for him. <i>She</i> would not think it
calamity: he would make her believe anything; she has a tendency to
immoderate attachment which she inwardly reproaches me for not
responding to, and already her mind is occupied with his fortunes.
He thinks of an easy conquest and of entering into my nest. That I
will hinder! Such a marriage would be fatal to Dorothea. Has he
ever persisted in anything except from contradiction? In knowledge
he has always tried to be showy at small cost. In religion he could
be, as long as it suited him, the facile echo of Dorothea's
vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from laxity? I utterly
distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to the utmost the
fulfilment of his designs."</p>
<p>The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left
strong measures open to him, but in ruminating on them his mind
inevitably dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that
the longing to get the nearest possible calculation had at last
overcome his proud reticence, and had determined him to ask
Lydgate’s opinion as to the nature of his illness.</p>
<p>He had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by
appointment at half-past three, and in answer to her anxious
question, whether he had felt ill, replied,—“No, I merely wish to
have his opinion concerning some habitual symptoms. You need not
see him, my dear. I shall give orders that he may be sent to me in
the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be taking my usual exercise.”</p>
<p>When Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon
slowly receding with his hands behind him according to his habit,
and his head bent forward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves
from the lofty limes were falling silently across the sombre
evergreens, while the lights and shadows slept side by side: there
was no sound but the cawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed
ear is a lullaby, or that last solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate,
conscious of an energetic frame in its prime, felt some compassion
when the figure which he was likely soon to overtake turned round,
and in advancing towards him showed more markedly than ever the
signs of premature age—the student’s bent shoulders, the emaciated
limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth. “Poor fellow,” he
thought, “some men with his years are like lions; one can tell
nothing of their age except that they are full grown.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, with his invariably polite
air, “I am exceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality. We
will, if you please, carry on our conversation in walking to and
fro.”</p>
<p>“I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of
unpleasant symptoms,” said Lydgate, filling up a pause.</p>
<p>“Not immediately—no. In order to account for that wish I must
mention—what it were otherwise needless to refer to—that my life,
on all collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible
importance from the incompleteness of labors which have extended
through all its best years. In short, I have long had on hand a
work which I would fain leave behind me in such a state, at least,
that it might be committed to the press by—others. Were I assured
that this is the utmost I can reasonably expect, that assurance
would be a useful circumscription of my attempts, and a guide in
both the positive and negative determination of my course.”</p>
<p>Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and
thrust it between the buttons of his single-breasted coat. To a
mind largely instructed in the human destiny hardly anything could
be more interesting than the inward conflict implied in his formal
measured address, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of
the head. Nay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than
the struggle of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which
has been all the significance of its life—a significance which is
to vanish as the waters which come and go where no man has need of
them? But there was nothing to strike others as sublime about Mr.
Casaubon, and Lydgate, who had some contempt at hand for futile
scholarship, felt a little amusement mingling with his pity. He was
at present too ill acquainted with disaster to enter into the
pathos of a lot where everything is below the level of tragedy
except the passionate egoism of the sufferer.</p>
<p>“You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?” he
said, wishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon’s purpose, which seemed
to be clogged by some hesitation.</p>
<p>“I do. You have not implied to me that the symptoms which—I am
bound to testify—you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a
fatal disease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know
the truth without reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact
statement of your conclusions: I request it as a friendly service.
If you can tell me that my life is not threatened by anything else
than ordinary casualties, I shall rejoice, on grounds which I have
already indicated. If not, knowledge of the truth is even more
important to me.”</p>
<p>“Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate;
“but the first thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions
are doubly uncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility,
but because diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found
predictions on. In any ease, one can hardly increase appreciably
the tremendous uncertainty of life.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon winced perceptibly, but bowed.</p>
<p>“I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty
degeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and
explored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so
very many years ago. A good deal of experience—a more lengthened
observation—is wanting on the subject. But after what you have
said, it is my duty to tell you that death from this disease is
often sudden. At the same time, no such result can be predicted.
Your condition may be consistent with a tolerably comfortable life
for another fifteen years, or even more. I could add no information
to this beyond anatomical or medical details, which would leave
expectation at precisely the same point.” Lydgate’s instinct was
fine enough to tell him that plain speech, quite free from
ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr. Casaubon as a tribute of
respect.</p>
<p>“I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment’s
pause. “One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate
what you have now told me to Mrs. Casaubon?”</p>
<p>“Partly—I mean, as to the possible issues.” Lydgate was going to
explain why he had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an
unmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his hand
slightly, and said again, “I thank you,” proceeding to remark on
the rare beauty of the day.</p>
<p>Lydgate, certain that his patient wished to be alone, soon left
him; and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward
continued to pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute
companionship in melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf
that fleeted across the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence
as in the presence of a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the
first time found himself looking into the eyes of death—who was
passing through one of those rare moments of experience when we
feel the truth of a commonplace, which is as different from what we
call knowing it, as the vision of waters upon the earth is
different from the delirious vision of the water which cannot be
had to cool the burning tongue. When the commonplace “We must all
die” transforms itself suddenly into the acute consciousness “I
must die—and soon,” then death grapples us, and his fingers are
cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as our mother
did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the
first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found himself
on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming oar,
not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an
hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it
onward in imagination to the other side of death, gazing
backward—perhaps with the divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with
the petty anxieties of self-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon’s bias
his acts will give us a clew to. He held himself to be, with some
private scholarly reservations, a believing Christian, as to
estimates of the present and hopes of the future. But what we
strive to gratify, though we may call it a distant hope, is an
immediate desire: the future estate for which men drudge up city
alleys exists already in their imagination and love. And Mr.
Casaubon’s immediate desire was not for divine communion and light
divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor man,
clung low and mist-like in very shady places.</p>
<p>Dorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away, and she
had stepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her
husband. But she hesitated, fearing to offend him by obtruding
herself; for her ardor, continually repulsed, served, with her
intense memory, to heighten her dread, as thwarted energy subsides
into a shudder; and she wandered slowly round the nearer clumps of
trees until she saw him advancing. Then she went towards him, and
might have represented a heaven-sent angel coming with a promise
that the short hours remaining should yet be filled with that
faithful love which clings the closer to a comprehended grief. His
glance in reply to hers was so chill that she felt her timidity
increased; yet she turned and passed her hand through his arm.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant
arm to cling with difficulty against his rigid arm.</p>
<p>There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which
this unresponsive hardness inflicted on her. That is a strong word,
but not too strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that
the seeds of joy are forever wasted, until men and women look round
with haggard faces at the devastation their own waste has made, and
say, the earth bears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial
knowledge. You may ask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon
should have behaved in that way. Consider that his was a mind which
shrank from pity: have you ever watched in such a mind the effect
of a suspicion that what is pressing it as a grief may be really a
source of contentment, either actual or future, to the being who
already offends by pitying? Besides, he knew little of Dorothea’s
sensations, and had not reflected that on such an occasion as the
present they were comparable in strength to his own sensibilities
about Carp’s criticisms.</p>
<p>Dorothea did not withdraw her arm, but she could not venture to
speak. Mr. Casaubon did not say, “I wish to be alone,” but he
directed his steps in silence towards the house, and as they
entered by the glass door on this eastern side, Dorothea withdrew
her arm and lingered on the matting, that she might leave her
husband quite free. He entered the library and shut himself in,
alone with his sorrow.</p>
<p>She went up to her boudoir. The open bow-window let in the
serene glory of the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the
lime-trees cast long shadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the
scene. She threw herself on a chair, not heeding that she was in
the dazzling sun-rays: if there were discomfort in that, how could
she tell that it was not part of her inward misery?</p>
<p>She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any
she had felt since her marriage. Instead of tears there came
words:—</p>
<p>“What have I done—what am I—that he should treat me so? He never
knows what is in my mind—he never cares. What is the use of
anything I do? He wishes he had never married me.”</p>
<p>She began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like
one who has lost his way and is weary, she sat and saw as in one
glance all the paths of her young hope which she should never find
again. And just as clearly in the miserable light she saw her own
and her husband’s solitude—how they walked apart so that she was
obliged to survey him. If he had drawn her towards him, she would
never have surveyed him—never have said, “Is he worth living for?”
but would have felt him simply a part of her own life. Now she said
bitterly, “It is his fault, not mine.” In the jar of her whole
being, Pity was overthrown. Was it her fault that she had believed
in him—had believed in his worthiness?—And what, exactly, was he?—
She was able enough to estimate him—she who waited on his glances
with trembling, and shut her best soul in prison, paying it only
hidden visits, that she might be petty enough to please him. In
such a crisis as this, some women begin to hate.</p>
<p>The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go
down again, but would send a message to her husband saying that she
was not well and preferred remaining up-stairs. She had never
deliberately allowed her resentment to govern her in this way
before, but she believed now that she could not see him again
without telling him the truth about her feeling, and she must wait
till she could do it without interruption. He might wonder and be
hurt at her message. It was good that he should wonder and be hurt.
Her anger said, as anger is apt to say, that God was with her—that
all heaven, though it were crowded with spirits watching them, must
be on her side. She had determined to ring her bell, when there
came a rap at the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in
the library. He wished to be quite alone this evening, being much
occupied.</p>
<p>“I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.”</p>
<p>“Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?”</p>
<p>“No; I am not well. Get everything ready in my dressing room,
but pray do not disturb me again.”</p>
<p>Dorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle, while
the evening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed
continually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards
striking and ends with conquering his desire to strike. The energy
that would animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a
resolved submission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts
itself. That thought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her
husband—her conviction that he had been asking about the possible
arrest of all his work, and that the answer must have wrung his
heart, could not be long without rising beside the image of him,
like a shadowy monitor looking at her anger with sad remonstrance.
It cost her a litany of pictured sorrows and of silent cries that
she might be the mercy for those sorrows—but the resolved
submission did come; and when the house was still, and she knew
that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon habitually went to
rest, she opened her door gently and stood outside in the darkness
waiting for his coming up-stairs with a light in his hand. If he
did not come soon she thought that she would go down and even risk
incurring another pang. She would never again expect anything else.
But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light
advanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the
carpet. When her husband stood opposite to her, she saw that his
face was more haggard. He started slightly on seeing her, and she
looked up at him beseechingly, without speaking.</p>
<p>“Dorothea!“ he said, with a gentle surprise in his tone. ”Were
you waiting for me?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I did not like to disturb you.”</p>
<p>“Come, my dear, come. You are young, and need not to extend your
life by watching.”</p>
<p>When the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea’s
ears, she felt something like the thankfulness that might well up
in us if we had narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She put
her hand into her husband’s, and they went along the broad corridor
together.</p>
