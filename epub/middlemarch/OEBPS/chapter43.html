        This figure hath high price: ’t was wrought with love <br/>
        Ages ago in finest ivory;<br/>
        Nought modish in it, pure and noble lines<br/>
        Of generous womanhood that fits all time<br/>
        That too is costly ware; majolica<br/>
        Of deft design, to please a lordly eye:<br/>
        The smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful<br/>
        As mere Faience! a table ornament<br/>
        To suit the richest mounting."

<p class="noindent"><span class="firstletter">D</span>orothea seldom left home without her husband, but she did
occasionally drive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of
shopping or charity such as occur to every lady of any wealth when
she lives within three miles of a town. Two days after that scene
in the Yew-tree Walk, she determined to use such an opportunity in
order if possible to see Lydgate, and learn from him whether her
husband had really felt any depressing change of symptoms which he
was concealing from her, and whether he had insisted on knowing the
utmost about himself. She felt almost guilty in asking for
knowledge about him from another, but the dread of being without
it—the dread of that ignorance which would make her unjust or
hard—overcame every scruple. That there had been some crisis in her
husband's mind she was certain: he had the very next day begun a
new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite
newly in carrying out his plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up
stores of patience.</p>
<p>It was about four o’clock when she drove to Lydgate’s house in
Lowick Gate, wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at
home, that she had written beforehand. And he was not at home.</p>
<p>“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that
she knew of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the
marriage. Yes, Mrs. Lydgate was at home.</p>
<p>“I will go in and speak to her, if she will allow me. Will you
ask her if she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few
minutes?”</p>
<p>When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea
could hear sounds of music through an open window—a few notes from
a man’s voice and then a piano bursting into roulades. But the
roulades broke off suddenly, and then the servant came back saying
that Mrs. Lydgate would be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.</p>
<p>When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there
was a sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the
habits of the different ranks were less blent than now. Let those
who know, tell us exactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in
those days of mild autumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the
touch and soft to the eye. It always seemed to have been lately
washed, and to smell of the sweet hedges—was always in the shape of
a pelisse with sleeves hanging all out of the fashion. Yet if she
had entered before a still audience as Imogene or Cato’s daughter,
the dress might have seemed right enough: the grace and dignity
were in her limbs and neck; and about her simply parted hair and
candid eyes the large round poke which was then in the fate of
women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold trencher we
call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no dramatic
heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.
Casaubon. To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not
mixing with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner
or appearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not
without satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity
of studying <i>her</i>. What is the use of being exquisite if you
are not seen by the best judges? and since Rosamond had received
the highest compliments at Sir Godwin Lydgate's, she felt quite
confident of the impression she must make on people of good birth.
Dorothea put out her hand with her usual simple kindness, and
looked admiringly at Lydgate's lovely bride—aware that there was a
gentleman standing at a distance, but seeing him merely as a coated
figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was too much occupied with
the presence of the one woman to reflect on the contrast between
the two—a contrast that would certainly have been striking to a
calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were on a level;
but imagine Rosamond's infantine blondness and wondrous crown of
hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so
perfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a
large embroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders
would know the price of, her small hands duly set off with rings,
and that controlled self-consciousness of manner which is the
expensive substitute for simplicity.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,” said
Dorothea, immediately. “I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if
possible, before I go home, and I hoped that you might possibly
tell me where I could find him, or even allow me to wait for him,
if you expect him soon.”</p>
<p>“He is at the New Hospital,” said Rosamond; “I am not sure how
soon he will come home. But I can send for him.”</p>
<p>“Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming
forward. He had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered.
She colored with surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of
unmistakable pleasure, saying—</p>
<p>“I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you
here.”</p>
<p>“May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to
see him?” said Will.</p>
<p>“It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said
Dorothea, “if you will be kind enough to give the message to the
coachman.”</p>
<p>Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had
flashed in an instant over many connected memories, turned quickly
and said, “I will go myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time
before getting home again. I will drive to the Hospital and see Mr.
Lydgate there. Pray excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged
to you.”</p>
<p>Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she
left the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around
her—hardly conscious that Will opened the door for her and offered
her his arm to lead her to the carriage. She took the arm but said
nothing. Will was feeling rather vexed and miserable, and found
nothing to say on his side. He handed her into the carriage in
silence, they said good-by, and Dorothea drove away.</p>
<p>In the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some
reflections that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her
preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense
that there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing
any further intercourse between herself and Will which she was
unable to mention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking
Lydgate was a matter of concealment. That was all that had been
explicitly in her mind; but she had been urged also by a vague
discomfort. Now that she was alone in her drive, she heard the
notes of the man’s voice and the accompanying piano, which she had
not noted much at the time, returning on her inward sense; and she
found herself thinking with some wonder that Will Ladislaw was
passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her husband’s absence. And
then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time
with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any
unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and
one towards whom she was bound to show kindness. Still there had
been signs which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying
that Mr. Casaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own
absence. “Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor
Dorothea to herself, while the tears came rolling and she had to
dry them quickly. She felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of
Will which had been so clear to her before was mysteriously
spoiled. But the carriage stopped at the gate of the Hospital. She
was soon walking round the grass plots with Lydgate, and her
feelings recovered the strong bent which had made her seek for this
interview.</p>
<p>Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of
it clearly enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and
here for the first time there had come a chance which had set him
at a disadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that
she was not supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him
under circumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely
occupied with her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her,
amongst the circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life.
But that was not his fault: of course, since he had taken his
lodgings in the town, he had been making as many acquaintances as
he could, his position requiring that he should know everybody and
everything. Lydgate was really better worth knowing than any one
else in the neighborhood, and he happened to have a wife who was
musical and altogether worth calling upon. Here was the whole
history of the situation in which Diana had descended too
unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was mortifying. Will was
conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for
Dorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him
from her with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more
fatal to the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance
between Rome and Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were
easy enough to defy in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr.
Casaubon; but prejudices, like odorous bodies, have a double
existence both solid and subtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as
the twentieth echo of an echo, or as the memory of hyacinths which
once scented the darkness. And Will was of a temperament to feel
keenly the presence of subtleties: a man of clumsier perceptions
would not have felt, as he did, that for the first time some sense
of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had sprung up in
Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted her to the
carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his hatred
and jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid
below her socially. Confound Casaubon!</p>
<p>Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up his hat, and looking
irritated as he advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated
herself at her work-table, said—</p>
<p>“It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I
come another day and just finish about the rendering of ’Lungi dal
caro bene’?”</p>
<p>“I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure
you admit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite
envy your acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? She
looks as if she were.”</p>
<p>“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.</p>
<p>“That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him
if she were handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of
when you are with Mrs. Casaubon?”</p>
<p>“Herself,“ said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming
Mrs. Lydgate. ”When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of
her attributes—one is conscious of her presence.“</p>
<p>“I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond,
dimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. “He will come back and
think nothing of me.”</p>
<p>“That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto.
Mrs. Casaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared
with her.”</p>
<p>“You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I
suppose.”</p>
<p>“No,“ said Will, almost pettishly. ”Worship is usually a matter
of theory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess
just at this moment—I must really tear myself away.</p>
<p>“Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the
music, and I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”</p>
<p>When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in
front of him and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr.
Ladislaw was here singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He
seemed vexed. Do you think he disliked her seeing him at our house?
Surely your position is more than equal to his—whatever may be his
relation to the Casaubons.”</p>
<p>“No, no; it must be something else if he were really vexed,
Ladislaw is a sort of gypsy; he thinks nothing of leather and
prunella.”</p>
<p>“Music apart, he is not always very agreeable. Do you like
him?”</p>
<p>“Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and
bric-a-brac, but likable.”</p>
<p>“Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.”</p>
<p>“Poor devil!” said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife’s
ears.</p>
<p>Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the
world, especially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried
girlhood had been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in
by-gone costumes—that women, even after marriage, might make
conquests and enslave men. At that time young ladies in the
country, even when educated at Mrs. Lemon’s, read little French
literature later than Racine, and public prints had not cast their
present magnificent illumination over the scandals of life. Still,
vanity, with a woman’s whole mind and day to work in, can construct
abundantly on slight hints, especially on such a hint as the
possibility of indefinite conquests. How delightful to make
captives from the throne of marriage with a husband as crown-prince
by your side—himself in fact a subject—while the captives look up
forever hopeless, losing their rest probably, and if their appetite
too, so much the better! But Rosamond’s romance turned at present
chiefly on her crown-prince, and it was enough to enjoy his assured
subjection. When he said, “Poor devil!” she asked, with playful
curiosity—</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you
mermaids? He only neglects his work and runs up bills.”</p>
<p>“I am sure you do not neglect your work. You are always at the
Hospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor’s
quarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your
microscope and phials. Confess you like those things better than
me.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be
something better than a Middlemarch doctor?” said Lydgate, letting
his hands fall on to his wife’s shoulders, and looking at her with
affectionate gravity. “I shall make you learn my favorite bit from
an old poet—</p>
<p class="poem">’Why should our pride make such a stir to be<br/>
And be forgot? What good is like to this,<br/>
To do worthy the writing, and to write<br/>
Worthy the reading and the worlds delight?'<br/></p>
<p>What I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,—and to write out
myself what I have done. A man must work, to do that, my pet.“</p>
<p>“Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more
wish you to attain a high position in some better place than
Middlemarch. You cannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you
from working. But we cannot live like hermits. You are not
discontented with me, Tertius?”</p>
<p>“No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented.”</p>
<p>“But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to you?”</p>
<p>“Merely to ask about her husband’s health. But I think she is
going to be splendid to our New Hospital: I think she will give us
two hundred a-year.”</p>
