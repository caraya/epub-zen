<p id="id1036228"><span id="id120242"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->

Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might
be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,
and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,
to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,
or not pretty at all.
</p>

<p id="id1036237"><span id="id120254"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,
to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;
and she made a point of Harriet’s going with her, that the worst of
the business might be gone through as soon as possible.
</p>

<p id="id1036246"><span id="id120263"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room
to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,
to lace up her boot, without recollecting.  A thousand vexatious
thoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;
and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be
recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather
pale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so
much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma
would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,
and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms
of being “elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.”
</p>

<p id="id1036249"><span id="id120268"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find fault,
but she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not elegance.—
She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,
there was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face
not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,
were elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.
</p>

<p id="id1036252"><span id="id120275"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would
not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. 
It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. 
The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,
and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own
good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly
unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with
the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,
and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him
to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,
and as little really easy as could be.
</p>

<p id="id1036255"><span id="id120281"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted
the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;
“Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?—
Is not she very charming?”
</p>

<p id="id1036239"><span id="id120294"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
There was a little hesitation in Emma’s answer.
</p>

<p id="id1036261"><span id="id120304"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”
</p>

<p id="id1036272"><span id="id120312"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”
</p>

<p id="id1036277"><span id="id120320"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”
</p>

<p id="id1036282"><span id="id120329"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”
</p>

<p id="id1036289"><span id="id120337"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune;
and she came in his way.”
</p>

<p id="id1036296"><span id="id120348"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she
was very much attached to him.”
</p>

<p id="id1036284"><span id="id120358"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the
woman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,
and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.”
</p>

<p id="id1036310"><span id="id120371"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes,“ said Harriet earnestly, ”and well she might, nobody could ever
have a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,
Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. 
He is just as superior as ever;—but being married, you know,
it is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need
not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery. 
To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!—
She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. 
Happy creature!  He called her ‘Augusta.’  How delightful!“
</p>

<p id="id1036313"><span id="id120377"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then
see more and judge better.  From Harriet’s happening not to be
at Hartfield, and her father’s being present to engage Mr. Elton,
she had a quarter of an hour of the lady’s conversation to herself,
and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite
convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well
satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;
that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which
had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her
notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;
that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would
certainly do Mr. Elton no good.
</p>

<p id="id1036316"><span id="id120385"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Harriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined herself,
she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,
it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best
of her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride
of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride
of him.
</p>

<p id="id1036319"><span id="id120391"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother
Mr. Suckling’s seat;”—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. 
The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the
house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably
impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she
could see or imagine.  “Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite
struck by the likeness!—That room was the very shape and size
of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister’s favourite room.”—
Mr. Elton was appealed to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—
She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.”
</p>

<p id="id1036322"><span id="id120398"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like
the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. 
I really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so
extremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy
months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,
undoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;
but to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,
like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it
is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. 
I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.”
</p>

<p id="id1036326"><span id="id120404"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient
for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.
</p>

<p id="id1036329"><span id="id120413"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house—
the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly
like.  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here,
and stand very much in the same way—just across the lawn;
and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,
which put me so exactly in mind!  My brother and sister will be
enchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds
themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.”
</p>

<p id="id1036337"><span id="id120419"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea
that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little
for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth
while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said
in reply,
</p>

<p id="id1036340"><span id="id120431"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think
you have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.”
</p>

<p id="id1036344"><span id="id120442"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,
you know.  Surry is the garden of England.”
</p>

<p id="id1036356"><span id="id120452"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. 
Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,
as well as Surry.”
</p>

<p id="id1036303"><span id="id120464"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.“
I never heard any county but Surry called so.”
</p>

<p id="id1036370"><span id="id120475"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma was silenced.
</p>

<p id="id1036373"><span id="id120482"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,
or summer at farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be
our time for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore
a great deal, I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau,
of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying
any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different
beauties extremely well.  They would hardly come in their chaise,
I think, at that season of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on,
I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;
it will be so very much preferable.  When people come into a beautiful
country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes
them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond
of exploring.  We explored to King’s-Weston twice last summer,
in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the
barouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,
Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”
</p>

<p id="id1036376"><span id="id120488"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;
and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed
to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.”
</p>

<p id="id1036386"><span id="id120495"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. 
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite
a proverb for it at Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said,
when she has been going to Bristol, ‘I really cannot get this girl
to move from the house.  I absolutely must go in by myself, though I
hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;
but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir
beyond the park paling.’  Many a time has she said so; and yet I
am no advocate for entire seclusion.  I think, on the contrary,
when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very
bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. 
I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse—
(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father’s state of health must
be a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he should. 
Let me recommend Bath to you.  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing
Mr. Woodhouse good.”
</p>

<p id="id1036378"><span id="id120502"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving
any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown
to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be
useful now.”
</p>

<p id="id1036392"><span id="id120516"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief
they give.  In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! 
And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of
use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes
much depressed.  And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy I
need not take much pains to dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath
to the young are pretty generally understood.  It would be a charming
introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could
immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. 
A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my
particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided
with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,
and would be the very person for you to go into public with.”
</p>

<p id="id1036389"><span id="id120522"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. 
The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called
an introduction—of her going into public under the auspices
of a friend of Mrs. Elton’s—probably some vulgar, dashing widow,
who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!—
The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!
</p>

<p id="id1036402"><span id="id120531"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could
have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going
to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly
convinced that the place might suit her better than her father.” 
And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the
subject directly.
</p>

<p id="id1036407"><span id="id120538"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these occasions,
a lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long
known that you are a superior performer.”
</p>

<p id="id1036410"><span id="id120549"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. 
A superior performer!—very far from it, I assure you. 
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came. 
I am doatingly fond of music—passionately fond;—and my friends
say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,
upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree. 
You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you
it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,
to hear what a musical society I am got into.  I absolutely cannot
do without music.  It is a necessary of life to me; and having always
been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,
it would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much
to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing
his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;
and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had been
accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension. 
When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the
world I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear
of retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,
the world was not necessary to me.  I could do very well without it. 
To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my
resources made me quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms
than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought. 
I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description. 
Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I
did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,
nor were spacious apartments.  ‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest,
I do not think I can live without something of a musical society. 
I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank
to me.’”
</p>

<p id="id1036404"><span id="id120556"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury;
and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than
may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.”
</p>

<p id="id1036419"><span id="id120562"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted
to find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet
little concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I
must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings
at your house, or ours.  Will not it be a good plan?  If we
exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. 
Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me,
as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know—
there is a sad story against them, in general.  They are but too apt
to give up music.”
</p>

<p id="id1036430"><span id="id120569"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can
be no danger, surely?”
</p>

<p id="id1036423"><span id="id120579"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,
I tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music—never touches
the instrument—though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said
of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two Milmans,
now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. 
Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used to be
quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend
that a married woman has many things to call her attention. 
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.”
</p>

<p id="id1036440"><span id="id120585"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon
be in so regular a train—”
</p>

<p id="id1036437"><span id="id120595"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well,“ said Mrs. Elton, laughing, ”we shall see.“
</p>

<p id="id1036450"><span id="id120603"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,
had nothing more to say; and, after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Elton
chose another subject.
</p>

<p id="id1036458"><span id="id120617"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them
both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. 
I like them extremely.  Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature—
quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you. 
And she appears so truly good—there is something so motherly
and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly. 
She was your governess, I think?”
</p>

<p id="id1036465"><span id="id120622"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton
hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.
</p>

<p id="id1036468"><span id="id120630"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her
so very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”
</p>

<p id="id1036477"><span id="id120641"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mrs. Weston’s manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good. 
Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest
model for any young woman.”
</p>

<p id="id1036485"><span id="id120654"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“And who do you think came in while we were there?”
</p>

<p id="id1036470"><span id="id120662"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance—
and how could she possibly guess?
</p>

<p id="id1036497"><span id="id120674"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Knightley!“ continued Mrs. Elton; ”Knightley himself!—Was not
it lucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day,
I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a
friend of Mr. E.’s, I had a great curiosity.  ‘My friend Knightley’
had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;
and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not
be ashamed of his friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman. 
I like him very much.  Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.“
</p>

<p id="id1036500"><span id="id120680"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Happily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma
could breathe.
</p>

<p id="id1036491"><span id="id120688"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation.  “Worse than I
had supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!—I could not
have believed it.  Knightley!—never seen him in her life before,
and call him Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! 
A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo,
and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and
underbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is
a gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,
and discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it! 
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club! 
One would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!—
Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be
a gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal. 
Much beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. 
Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here? 
How angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am—
thinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of! 
How I catch myself out!  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into
my mind!”—
</p>

<p id="id1036509"><span id="id120694"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time
her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons’
departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable
of attending.
</p>

<p id="id1036507"><span id="id120710"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw
her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say
she was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick. 
A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. 
But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks
like you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,
pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. 
Though I think he had better not have married.  I made the best
excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton
on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course
of the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon
a bride is very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am! 
But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.”
</p>

<p id="id1036521"><span id="id120714"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you.”
</p>

<p id="id1036527"><span id="id120724"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes:  but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects
to her if possible.  It was being very deficient.”
</p>

<p id="id1036534"><span id="id120735"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore
why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride? 
It ought to be no recommendation to you.  It is encouraging people
to marry if you make so much of them.”
</p>

<p id="id1036542"><span id="id120750"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would
always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride,
especially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to her. 
A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,
let the others be who they may.”
</p>

<p id="id1036545"><span id="id120756"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know
what is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your
sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”
</p>

<p id="id1036553"><span id="id120769"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a
matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,
and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.”
</p>

<p id="id1036558"><span id="id120782"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not
understand her.  Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton’s offences,
and long, very long, did they occupy her.
