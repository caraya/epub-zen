There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John
Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning
among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking
over what she had done every evening with her father and sister. 
She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass
so swiftly.  It was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being much too short.
</p>

<p id="id1032380"><span id="id113636"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than
their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out
of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. 
Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls
one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible
thing in preference to a division of the party.
</p>

<p id="id1032383"><span id="id113643"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty
if he could, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses
were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than
a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;
nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one
of the carriages find room for Harriet also.
</p>

<p id="id1032388"><span id="id113652"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,
were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early,
as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination
being consulted in every thing.
</p>

<p id="id1032385"><span id="id113667"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event
that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been
spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed
with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed
by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. 
Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed
with regard to Randalls.  She was very feverish and had a bad
sore throat:  Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry
was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist
the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,
though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
</p>

<p id="id1032400"><span id="id113672"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s
unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much
Mr. Elton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her
at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having
a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. 
She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she
was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as
they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid—
of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going
to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield—
they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the
daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,
glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed
to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they
were hastening home for.  They joined company and proceeded together. 
Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s complaint;—
“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,
a quick, low pulse, &amp;amp;c.  and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard
that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often
alarmed her with them.”  Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,
as he exclaimed,
</p>

<p id="id1032403"><span id="id113680"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious.  I hope not of a putrid
infectious sort.  Has Perry seen her?  Indeed you should take care
of yourself as well as of your friend.  Let me entreat you to run
no risks.  Why does not Perry see her?”
</p>

<p id="id1032406"><span id="id113694"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience
and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness
which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather
feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite
another subject,
</p>

<p id="id1032414"><span id="id113703"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much
like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,
I should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father
from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem
to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it
would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  But, upon
my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. 
You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider
what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,
I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home
and take care of yourself to-night.”
</p>

<p id="id1032398"><span id="id113708"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;
which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind
care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of
her’s, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—
but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions
and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,
was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its
being “very cold, certainly very cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in
having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power
of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.
</p>

<p id="id1032421"><span id="id113718"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies
to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.”
</p>

<p id="id1032418"><span id="id113716"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly
offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s
only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much
prompt satisfaction.  It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,
and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than
at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes
more exulting than when he next looked at her.
</p>

<p id="id1032431"><span id="id113734"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Well,“ said she to herself, ”this is most strange!—After I
had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave
Harriet ill behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe,
in many men, especially single men, such an inclination—
such a passion for dining out—a dinner engagement is so high in
the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,
almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it—and this must
be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young
man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,
he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked. 
What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,
but will not dine alone for her.“
</p>

<p id="id1032428"><span id="id113739"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment
in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his
voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard’s
for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared
for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be
able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself
off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.
</p>

<p id="id1032437"><span id="id113746"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley
began with—
</p>

<p id="id1032444"><span id="id113757"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than
Mr. Elton.  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. 
With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies
to please, every feature works.”
</p>

<p id="id1032452"><span id="id113771"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there
is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook
a great deal.  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,
he will have the advantage over negligent superiority.  There is
such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot
but value.”
</p>

<p id="id1032455"><span id="id113778"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes,“ said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,
”he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.“
</p>

<p id="id1032435"><span id="id113789"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Me!“ she replied with a smile of astonishment, ”are you imagining
me to be Mr. Elton’s object?“
</p>

<p id="id1032470"><span id="id113800"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never
occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.”
</p>

<p id="id1032478"><span id="id113812"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!”
</p>

<p id="id1032482"><span id="id113821"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether
it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. 
I think your manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend,
Emma.  You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,
and what you mean to do.”
</p>

<p id="id1032486"><span id="id113828"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.  Mr. Elton
and I are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on,
amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often
arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes
which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;
and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind
and ignorant, and in want of counsel.  He said no more.
</p>

<p id="id1032489"><span id="id113834"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,
that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea
of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually
with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent
consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full
of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at
Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. 
The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage
was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,
and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only
a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.
</p>

<p id="id1032484"><span id="id113841"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. 
The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice
of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,
which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;
and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in
expressing his discontent.
</p>

<p id="id1032496"><span id="id113856"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when
he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such
a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.  He must think
himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. 
It is the greatest absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—
The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home—and the
folly of people’s not staying comfortably at home when they can! 
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of
duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;—and here are we,
probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward
voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,
which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,
to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;—
here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another
man’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said
and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.
Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses
and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,
shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they
might have had at home.”
</p>

<p id="id1032499"><span id="id113862"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt
he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my love,”
which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;
but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer
at all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;
her heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to talk,
and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening
her lips.
</p>

<p id="id1032502"><span id="id113870"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,
and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. 
Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.  Mr. Elton
was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful
in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have
received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her. 
She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—
not better.”
</p>

<p id="id1032494"><span id="id113875"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“My report from Mrs. Goddard’s,” said she presently, “was not
so pleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was my answer.”
</p>

<p id="id1032513"><span id="id113887"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice
of sentiment as he answered.
</p>

<p id="id1032519"><span id="id113895"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that
when I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing
before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,
by no means better, rather worse.  Very much grieved and concerned—
I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial
as I knew had been given her in the morning.”
</p>

<p id="id1032524"><span id="id113902"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Emma smiled and answered—“My visit was of use to the nervous part
of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;
it is a most severe cold indeed.  Mr. Perry has been with her,
as you probably heard.”
</p>

<p id="id1032532"><span id="id113917"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”
</p>

<p id="id1032536"><span id="id113926"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.  But it is
impossible not to feel uneasiness.  Such a sad loss to our party to-day!”
</p>

<p id="id1032545"><span id="id113940"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”
</p>

<p id="id1032550"><span id="id113949"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;
but it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay when
only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
</p>

<p id="id1032558"><span id="id113961"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin
for carriages.  How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to
feel cold with such precautions.  The contrivances of modern days
indeed have rendered a gentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. 
One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath
of air can find its way unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely
of no consequence.  It is a very cold afternoon—but in this carriage
we know nothing of the matter.—Ha! snows a little I see.”
</p>

<p id="id1032538"><span id="id113968"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Yes,“ said John Knightley, ”and I think we shall have a good deal
of it.“
</p>

<p id="id1032569"><span id="id113978"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton.  “Quite seasonable;
and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not
begin yesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very
possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had
there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. 
This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.  At Christmas
every body invites their friends about them, and people think little
of even the worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend’s house once
for a week.  Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night,
and could not get away till that very day se’nnight.”
</p>

<p id="id1032563"><span id="id113985"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,
but said only, coolly,
</p>

<p id="id1032579"><span id="id113993"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”
</p>

<p id="id1032573"><span id="id114002"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too
much astonished now at Mr. Elton’s spirits for other feelings. 
Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
</p>

<p id="id1032591"><span id="id114017"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing
in the greatest comfort.  Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—
Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly
what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;—
it will be a small party, but where small parties are select,
they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.  Mr. Weston’s dining-room
does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,
I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than
exceed by two.  I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft
air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,
though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties
of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”
</p>

<p id="id1032595"><span id="id114023"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine
with any body.”
</p>

<p id="id1032602"><span id="id114033"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the
law had been so great a slavery.  Well, sir, the time must come
when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little
labour and great enjoyment.”
</p>

<p id="id1032609"><span id="id114048"><!--anchor--></span><!--after-->
“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed through
the sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.”
